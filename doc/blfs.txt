Preface

   Having helped out with Linux From Scratch for a short time, I noticed that
   we were getting many queries as to how to do things beyond the base LFS
   system. At the time, the only assistance specifically offered relating to
   LFS were the LFS hints (http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/hints). Most of
   the LFS hints are extremely good and well written but I (and others) could
   still see a need for more comprehensive help to go Beyond LFS - hence
   BLFS.

   BLFS aims to be more than the LFS-hints converted to XML although much of
   our work is based around the hints and indeed some authors write both
   hints and the relevant BLFS sections. We hope that we can provide you with
   enough information to not only manage to build your system up to what you
   want, whether it be a web server or a multimedia desktop system, but also
   that you will learn a lot about system configuration as you go.

   Thanks as ever go to everyone in the LFS/BLFS community; especially those
   who have contributed instructions, written text, answered questions and
   generally shouted when things were wrong!

   Finally, we encourage you to become involved in the community; ask
   questions on the mailing list or news gateway and join in the fun on #lfs
   at irc.linuxfromscratch.org. You can find more details about all of these
   in the Introduction section of the book.

   Enjoy using BLFS.

   I still remember how I found the BLFS project and started using the
   instructions that were completed at the time. I could not believe how
   wonderful it was to get an application up and running very quickly, with
   explanations as to why things were done a certain way. Unfortunately, for
   me, it wasn't long before I was opening applications that had nothing more
   than "To be done" on the page. I did what most would do, I waited for
   someone else to do it. It wasn't too long before I am looking through
   Bugzilla for something easy to do. As with any learning experience, the
   definition of what was easy kept changing.

   We still encourage you to become involved as BLFS is never really
   finished. Contributing or just using, we hope you enjoy your BLFS
   experience.

   The BLFS project is a natural progression of LFS. Together, these projects
   provide a unique resource for the Open Source Community. They take the
   mystery out of the process of building a complete, functional software
   system from the source code contributed by many talented individuals
   throughout the world. They truly allow users to implement the slogan "Your
   distro, your rules."

   Our goal is to continue to provide the best resource available that shows
   you how to integrate many significant Open Source applications. Since
   these applications are constantly updated and new applications are
   developed, this book will never be complete. Additionally, there is always
   room for improvement in explaining the nuances of how to install the
   different packages. To make these improvements, we need your feedback. I
   encourage you to participate on the different mailing lists, news groups,
   and IRC channels to help meet these goals.

     BLFS Editor (June 2004âDecember 2006)

   My introduction to the [B]LFS project was actually by accident. I was
   trying to build a GNOME environment using some how-tos and other
   information I found on the web. A couple of times I ran into some build
   issues and Googling pulled up some old BLFS mailing list messages. Out for
   curiosity, I visited the Linux From Scratch web site and shortly
   thereafter was hooked. I've not used any other Linux distribution for
   personal use since.

   I can't promise anyone will feel the sense of satisfaction I felt after
   building my first few systems using [B]LFS instructions, but I sincerely
   hope that your BLFS experience is as rewarding for you as it has been for
   me.

   The BLFS project has grown significantly the last couple of years. There
   are more package instructions and related dependencies than ever before.
   The project requires your input for continued success. If you discover
   that you enjoy building BLFS, please consider helping out in any way you
   can. BLFS requires hundreds of hours of maintenance to keep it even
   semi-current. If you feel confident enough in your editing skills, please
   consider joining the BLFS team. Simply contributing to the mailing list
   discussions with sound advice and/or providing patches to the book's XML
   will probably result in you receiving an invitation to join the team.

Foreword

   This version of the book is intended to be used when building on top of a
   system built using the LFS book. Every effort has been made to ensure
   accuracy and reliability of the instructions. Many people find that using
   the instructions in this book after building the current stable or
   development version of LFS provides a stable and very modern Linux system.

   Enjoy!

Who Would Want to Read this Book

   This book is mainly aimed at those who have built a system based on the
   LFS book. It will also be useful for those who are using other
   distributions, but for one reason or another want to manually build
   software and are in need of some assistance. Note that the material
   contained in this book, in particular the dependency listings, is based
   upon the assumption that you are using a base LFS system with every
   package listed in the LFS book already installed and configured. BLFS can
   be used to create a range of diverse systems and so the target audience is
   probably nearly as wide as that of the LFS book. If you found LFS useful,
   you should also like this!

Organization

   This book is divided into the following parts.

  Part I - Introduction

   This part contains information which is essential to the rest of the book.

  Part II - Post LFS Configuration and Extra Software

   Here we introduce basic configuration and security issues. We also discuss
   a range of editors, file systems, and shells which aren't covered in the
   main LFS book.

  Part III - General Libraries and Utilities

   In this section we cover libraries which are often needed by the rest of
   the book as well as system utilities. Information on Programming
   (including recompiling GCC to support its full range of languages)
   concludes this part.

  Part IV - Basic Networking

   Here we cover how to connect to a network when you aren't using the simple
   static IP setup given in the main LFS book. Networking libraries and
   command-line networking tools are also covered here.

  Part V - Servers

   Here we deal with setting up mail and other servers (such as SSH, Apache,
   etc.).

  Part VI - X + Window Managers

   This part explains how to set up a basic X Window System installation
   along with some generic X libraries and Window managers.

  Part VII - KDE

   For those who want to use the K Desktop Environment or some parts of it,
   this part covers it.

  Part VIII - GNOME

   GNOME is the main alternative to KDE in the Desktop Environment arena.

  Part IX - Xfce

   Xfce is a lightweight alternative to GNOME and KDE.

  Part X - X Software

   Office programs and graphical web browsers are important to most people.
   They, along with some generic X software can be found in this part of the
   book.

  Part XI - Multimedia

   Here we cover setting multimedia libraries and drivers along with some
   audio, video and CD-writing programs.

  Part XII - Printing, Scanning and Typesetting (PST)

   The PST part of the book covers document handling with applications like
   Ghostscript, CUPS and DocBook to installing texlive.

  Appendices

   The Appendices cover information which doesn't belong in the main book;
   they are mainly there as a reference.

                              Part I. Introduction

Chapter 1. Welcome to BLFS

   The Beyond Linux From Scratch book is designed to carry on from where the
   LFS book leaves off. But unlike the LFS book, it isn't designed to be
   followed straight through. Reading the Which sections of the book? part of
   this chapter should help guide you through the book.

   Please read most of this part of the book carefully as it explains quite a
   few of the conventions used throughout the book.

Which Sections of the Book Do I Want?

   Unlike the Linux From Scratch book, BLFS isn't designed to be followed in
   a linear manner. This is because LFS provides instructions on how to
   create a base system which is capable of turning into anything from a web
   server to a multimedia desktop system. BLFS attempts to guide you in the
   process of going from the base system to your intended destination. Choice
   is very much involved.

   Everyone who reads the book will want to read certain sections. The
   Introduction part, which you are currently reading, contains generic
   information. Especially take note of the information in Chapter 2,
   Important Information, as this contains comments about how to unpack
   software, issues related to using different locales and various other
   aspects which apply throughout the book.

   The part on Post LFS Configuration and Extra Software is where most people
   will want to turn next. This deals with not just configuration but also
   Security (Chapter 4, Security), File Systems (Chapter 5, File Systems and
   Disk Management), Editors (Chapter 6, Editors) and Shells (Chapter 7,
   Shells). Indeed, you may wish to reference certain parts of this chapter
   (especially the sections on Editors and File Systems) while building your
   LFS system.

   Following these basic items, most people will want to at least browse
   through the General Libraries and Utilities part of the book. This part
   contains information on many items which are prerequisites for other
   sections of the book as well as some items (such as Chapter 13,
   Programming) which are useful in their own right. Note that you don't have
   to install all of these libraries and packages found in this part to start
   with as each BLFS installation procedure tells you which packages it
   depends upon so you can choose the program you want to install and see
   what it needs.

   Likewise, most people will probably want to look at the Networking part.
   It deals with connecting to the Internet or your LAN (Chapter 14,
   Connecting to a Network) using a variety of methods such as DHCP and PPP,
   and with items such as Networking Libraries (Chapter 17, Networking
   Libraries) and various basic networking programs and utilities.

   Once you have dealt with these basics, you may wish to configure more
   advanced network services. These are dealt with in the Servers part of the
   book. Those wanting to build servers should find a good starting point
   there. Note that this section also contains information on various
   database packages.

   The next parts of the book principally deal with desktop systems. This
   portion of the book starts with a part talking about X plus Window and
   Display Managers. This part also deals with some generic X-based libraries
   (Chapter 25, X Libraries). After this, KDE and GNOME are given their own
   parts which are followed by one on X Software.

   The book then moves on to deal with Multimedia packages. Note that many
   people may want to use the ALSA-1.1.9 instructions from this chapter quite
   near the start of their BLFS journey; they are placed here simply because
   it is the most logical place for them.

   The final part of the main BLFS book deals with Printing, Scanning and
   Typesetting. This is useful for most people with desktop systems and even
   those who are creating mainly server systems will find it useful.

   We hope you enjoy using BLFS and find it useful.

Conventions Used in this Book

  Typographical Conventions

   To make things easy to follow, there are a number of conventions used
   throughout the book. Following are some examples:

 ./configure --prefix=/usr

     This form of text is designed to be typed exactly as seen unless
     otherwise noted in the surrounding text. It is also used to identify
     references to specific commands.

 install-info: unknown option
 `--dir-file=/mnt/lfs/usr/info/dir'

     This form of text (fixed width text) is showing screen output, probably
     a result from issuing a command. It is also used to show filenames such
     as /boot/grub/grub.conf

   Emphasis

     This form of text is used for several purposes in the book but mainly to
     emphasize important points or to give examples as to what to type.

   http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/

     This form of text is used for hypertext links external to the book such
     as HowTos, download locations, websites, etc.

   SeaMonkey-2.49.4

     This form of text is used for links internal to the book such as another
     section describing a different package.

 cat > $LFS/etc/group << "EOF"
 root:x:0:
 bin:x:1:
 ......
 EOF

     This type of section is used mainly when creating configuration files.
     The first command (in bold) tells the system to create the file
     $LFS/etc/group from whatever is typed on the following lines until the
     sequence EOF is encountered. Therefore, this whole section is generally
     typed as seen.

   <REPLACED TEXT>

     This form of text is used to encapsulate text that should be modified
     and is not to be typed as seen, or copy and pasted. Note that the square
     brackets are not part of the text, but should be substituted for as

  Conventions Used for Package Dependencies

   When packages are created, the authors depend on prior work. In order to
   build a package in BLFS, these dependencies must be built prior to the
   desired package. For each package, any prerequisite packages are listed in
   one or more separate sections: Required, Recommended, and Optional.

    Required Dependencies

   These dependencies are the minimum prerequisite packages required to build
   the package. Omitted from the list are packages in LFS and required
   dependencies of other required packages.

    Recommended Dependencies

   These dependencies are those that the BLFS editors have determined are
   important to give the package reasonable capabilities. Package
   installation instructions assume they are installed. If a recommended
   package is not desired, the instructions may need to be modified to
   accommodate the missing package.

    Optional Dependencies

   These dependencies are those that the package may use. Integration of
   optional dependencies may be automatic by the package or may need
   additional instructions not presented by BLFS. Optional packages may be
   listed without corresponding BLFS instructions. In this case it is up to
   the user to determine appropriate installation instructions.

  Conventions Used for Kernel Configuration Options

   Some packages have specific needs regarding the kernel configuration. The
   general layout is the following:

 Master section --->
   Subsection --->
     [*]     Required parameter                     [CONFIG_REQU_PAR]
     <*>     Required parameter (not as module)     [CONFIG_REQU_PAR_NMOD]
     <*/M>   Required parameter (could be a module) [CONFIG_REQU_PAR_MOD]
     <*/M/ > Optional parameter                     [CONFIG_OPT_PAR]
     [ ] Incompatible parameter                     [CONFIG_INCOMP_PAR]
     < > Incompatible parameter (even as module)    [CONFIG_INCOMP_PAR_MOD]

   [CONFIG_...] on the right gives the name of the option, so you can easily
   check whether it is set in your config file. The meaning of the various
   entries is:

     Master section                 top level menu item                       
     Subsection                     submenu item                              
     Required parameter             the option could be either built-in or    
                                    not selected: it must be selected         
     Required parameter (not as     the option could be either built-in,      
     module)                        module, or not selected: it must be       
                                    selected as built-in                      
     Required parameter (could be a the option could be either built-in,      
     module)                        module, or not selected: it must be       
                                    selected, either as built-in or module    
                                    rarely used: the option could be either   
     Optional parameter             built-in, module, or not selected: it may 
                                    be selected at will                       
     Incompatible parameter         the option could be either built-in or    
                                    not selected: it must not be selected     
     Incompatible parameter (even   the option could be either built-in,      
     as module)                     module, or not selected: it must not be   
                                    selected                                  

   Note that, depending on other selections, the angle brackets (<>) may
   appear as braces ({}), if the option cannot be unselected, or even dashes
   (-*- or -M-), when the choice is imposed. The help text about the option
   specifies the other selections on which this option relies, and how those
   other selections are set.

  SBU values in BLFS

   As in LFS, each package in BLFS has a build time listed in Standard Build
   Units (SBUs). These times are relative to the time it took to build
   binutils in LFS and are intended to provide some insight into how long it
   will take to build a package. Most times listed are for a single processor
   or core to build the package. In some cases, large, long running builds
   tested on multi-core systems have SBU times listed with comments such as
   '(parallelism=4)'. These values indicate testing was done using multiple
   cores. Note that while this speeds up the build on systems with the
   appropriate hardware, the speedup is not linear and to some extent depends
   on the individual package and specific hardware used.

   For packages which use ninja (e.g. anything using meson) or rust, by
   default all cores are used so similar comments will be seen on such
   packages even when the build time is minimal.

   Where even a parallel build takes more than 15 SBU, on certain machines
   the time may be considerably greater even when the build does not use
   swap. In particular, different micro-architectures will build some files
   at different relative speeds and this can introduce delays when certain
   make targets wait for another file to be created. Where a large build uses
   a lot of C++ files, processors with Simultaneous Multi Threading will
   share the Floating Point Unit and can take 45% longer than when using four
   'prime' cores (measured on an intel i7 using taskset and keeping the other
   cores idle).

   Some packages do not support parallel builds and using -j1 for the make
   command is required. Packages that are known to have such limits are
   marked as such in the text.

Book Version

   This is BLFS-BOOK version 9.0 dated September 1st, 2019. This is the 9.0
   branch of the BLFS book, currently targeting the LFS 9.0 book. For
   development versions, if this version is older than a month, it's likely
   that your mirror hasn't been synchronized recently and a newer version is
   probably available for download or viewing. Check one of the mirror sites
   at http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/mirrors.html for an updated version.

Mirror Sites

   The BLFS project has a number of mirrors set up world-wide to make it
   easier and more convenient for you to access the website. Please visit the
   http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/mirrors.html website for the list of
   current mirrors.

   Last updated on 2007-04-04 12:42:53 -0700

Getting the Source Packages

   Within the BLFS instructions, each package has two references for finding
   the source files for the packageâan HTTP link and an FTP link (some
   packages may only list one of these links). Every effort has been made to
   ensure that these links are accurate. However, the World Wide Web is in
   continuous flux. Packages are sometimes moved or updated and the exact URL
   specified is not always available.

   To overcome this problem, the BLFS Team, with the assistance of Oregon
   State University Open Source Lab, has made an HTTP/FTP site available
   through world wide mirrors. See
   http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/download.html#sources for a list.
   These sites have all the sources of the exact versions of the packages
   used in BLFS. If you can't find the BLFS package you need at the listed
   addresses, get it from these sites.

   We would like to ask a favor, however. Although this is a public resource
   for you to use, please do not abuse it. We have already had one unthinking
   individual download over 3 GB of data, including multiple copies of the
   same files that are placed at different locations (via symlinks) to make
   finding the right package easier. This person clearly did not know what
   files he needed and downloaded everything. The best place to download
   files is the site or sites set up by the source code developer. Please try
   there first.

Asking for Help and the FAQ

   If you encounter a problem while using this book, and your problem is not
   listed in the FAQ (http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/faq), you will find
   that most of the people on Internet Relay Chat (IRC) and on the mailing
   lists are willing to help you. An overview of the LFS mailing lists can be
   found in Mailing lists. To assist us in diagnosing and solving your
   problem, include as much relevant information as possible in your request
   for help.

  Things to Check Prior to Asking

   Before asking for help, you should review the following items:

     * Is the hardware support compiled into the kernel or available as a
       module to the kernel? If it is a module, is it configured properly in
       modprobe.conf and has it been loaded? You should use lsmod as the root
       user to see if it's loaded. Check the sys.log file or run modprobe
       <driver> to review any error message. If it loads properly, you may
       need to add the modprobe command to your boot scripts.

     * Are your permissions properly set, especially for devices? LFS uses
       groups to make these settings easier, but it also adds the step of
       adding users to groups to allow access. A simple usermod -G audio
       <user> may be all that's necessary for that user to have access to the
       sound system. Any question that starts out with âIt works as root, but
       not as ...â requires a thorough review of permissions prior to asking.

     * BLFS liberally uses /opt/<package>. The main objection to this centers
       around the need to expand your environment variables for each package
       placed there (e.g., PATH=$PATH:/opt/kde/bin). In most cases, the
       package instructions will walk you through the changes, but some will
       not. The section called âGoing Beyond BLFSâ is available to help you
       check.

  Things to Mention

   Apart from a brief explanation of the problem you're having, the essential
   things to include in your request are:

     * the version of the book you are using (being 9.0),

     * the package or section giving you problems,

     * the exact error message or symptom you are receiving,

     * whether you have deviated from the book or LFS at all,

     * if you are installing a BLFS package on a non-LFS system.

   (Note that saying that you've deviated from the book doesn't mean that we
   won't help you. It'll just help us to see other possible causes of your
   problem.)

   Expect guidance instead of specific instructions. If you are instructed to
   read something, please do so. It generally implies that the answer was way
   too obvious and that the question would not have been asked if a little
   research was done prior to asking. The volunteers in the mailing list
   prefer not to be used as an alternative to doing reasonable research on
   your end. In addition, the quality of your experience with BLFS is also
   greatly enhanced by this research, and the quality of volunteers is
   enhanced because they don't feel that their time has been abused, so they
   are far more likely to participate.

   An excellent article on asking for help on the Internet in general has
   been written by Eric S. Raymond. It is available online at
   http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html. Read and follow the
   hints in that document and you are much more likely to get a response to
   start with and also to get the help you actually need.

Chapter 2. Important Information

   This chapter is used to explain some of the policies used throughout the
   book, to introduce important concepts and to explain some issues you may
   see with some of the included packages.

Notes on Building Software

   Those people who have built an LFS system may be aware of the general
   principles of downloading and unpacking software. Some of that information
   is repeated here for those new to building their own software.

   Each set of installation instructions contains a URL from which you can
   download the package. The patches; however, are stored on the LFS servers
   and are available via HTTP. These are referenced as needed in the
   installation instructions.

   While you can keep the source files anywhere you like, we assume that you
   have unpacked the package and changed into the directory created by the
   unpacking process (the 'build' directory). We also assume you have
   uncompressed any required patches and they are in the directory
   immediately above the 'build' directory.

   We can not emphasize strongly enough that you should start from a clean
   source tree each time. This means that if you have had an error during
   configuration or compilation, it's usually best to delete the source tree
   and re-unpack it before trying again. This obviously doesn't apply if
   you're an advanced user used to hacking Makefiles and C code, but if in
   doubt, start from a clean tree.

  Building Software as an Unprivileged (non-root) User

   The golden rule of Unix System Administration is to use your superpowers
   only when necessary. Hence, BLFS recommends that you build software as an
   unprivileged user and only become the root user when installing the
   software. This philosophy is followed in all the packages in this book.
   Unless otherwise specified, all instructions should be executed as an
   unprivileged user. The book will advise you on instructions that need root
   privileges.

  Unpacking the Software

   If a file is in .tar format and compressed, it is unpacked by running one
   of the following commands:

 tar -xvf filename.tar.gz
 tar -xvf filename.tgz
 tar -xvf filename.tar.Z
 tar -xvf filename.tar.bz2

  Note

   You may omit using the v parameter in the commands shown above and below
   if you wish to suppress the verbose listing of all the files in the
   archive as they are extracted. This can help speed up the extraction as
   well as make any errors produced during the extraction more obvious to
   you.

   You can also use a slightly different method:

 bzcat filename.tar.bz2 | tar -xv

   Finally, you sometimes need to be able to unpack patches which are
   generally not in .tar format. The best way to do this is to copy the patch
   file to the parent of the 'build' directory and then run one of the
   following commands depending on whether the file is a .gz or .bz2 file:

 gunzip -v patchname.gz
 bunzip2 -v patchname.bz2

  Verifying File Integrity Using 'md5sum'

   Generally, to verify that the downloaded file is genuine and complete,
   many package maintainers also distribute md5sums of the files. To verify
   the md5sum of the downloaded files, download both the file and the
   corresponding md5sum file to the same directory (preferably from different
   on-line locations), and (assuming file.md5sum is the md5sum file
   downloaded) run the following command:

 md5sum -c file.md5sum

   If there are any errors, they will be reported. Note that the BLFS book
   includes md5sums for all the source files also. To use the BLFS supplied
   md5sums, you can create a file.md5sum (place the md5sum data and the exact
   name of the downloaded file on the same line of a file, separated by white
   space) and run the command shown above. Alternately, simply run the
   command shown below and compare the output to the md5sum data shown in the
   BLFS book.

 md5sum <name_of_downloaded_file>

  Creating Log Files During Installation

   For larger packages, it is convenient to create log files instead of
   staring at the screen hoping to catch a particular error or warning. Log
   files are also useful for debugging and keeping records. The following
   command allows you to create an installation log. Replace <command> with
   the command you intend to execute.

 ( <command> 2>&1 | tee compile.log && exit $PIPESTATUS )

   2>&1 redirects error messages to the same location as standard output. The
   tee command allows viewing of the output while logging the results to a
   file. The parentheses around the command run the entire command in a
   subshell and finally the exit $PIPESTATUS command ensures the result of
   the <command> is returned as the result and not the result of the tee
   command.

  Using Multiple Processors

   For many modern systems with multiple processors (or cores) the
   compilation time for a package can be reduced by performing a "parallel
   make" by either setting an environment variable or telling the make
   program how many processors are available. For instance, a Core2Duo can
   support two simultaneous processes with:

 export MAKEFLAGS='-j2'

   or just building with:

 make -j2

   Generally the number of processes should not exceed the number of cores
   supported by the CPU. To list the processors on your system, issue: grep
   processor /proc/cpuinfo.

   In some cases, using multiple processors may result in a 'race' condition
   where the success of the build depends on the order of the commands run by
   the make program. For instance, if an executable needs File A and File B,
   attempting to link the program before one of the dependent components is
   available will result in a failure. This condition usually arises because
   the upstream developer has not properly designated all the prerequisites
   needed to accomplish a step in the Makefile.

   If this occurs, the best way to proceed is to drop back to a single
   processor build. Adding '-j1' to a make command will override the similar
   setting in the MAKEFLAGS environment variable.

  Note

   When running the package tests or the install portion of the package build
   process, we do not recommend using an option greater than '-j1' unless
   specified otherwise. The installation procedures or checks have not been
   validated using parallel procedures and may fail with issues that are
   difficult to debug.

  Automated Building Procedures

   There are times when automating the building of a package can come in
   handy. Everyone has their own reasons for wanting to automate building,
   and everyone goes about it in their own way. Creating Makefiles, Bash
   scripts, Perl scripts or simply a list of commands used to cut and paste
   are just some of the methods you can use to automate building BLFS
   packages. Detailing how and providing examples of the many ways you can
   automate the building of packages is beyond the scope of this section.
   This section will expose you to using file redirection and the yes command
   to help provide ideas on how to automate your builds.

    File Redirection to Automate Input

   You will find times throughout your BLFS journey when you will come across
   a package that has a command prompting you for information. This
   information might be configuration details, a directory path, or a
   response to a license agreement. This can present a challenge to automate
   the building of that package. Occasionally, you will be prompted for
   different information in a series of questions. One method to automate
   this type of scenario requires putting the desired responses in a file and
   using redirection so that the program uses the data in the file as the
   answers to the questions.

   Building the CUPS package is a good example of how redirecting a file as
   input to prompts can help you automate the build. If you run the test
   suite, you are asked to respond to a series of questions regarding the
   type of test to run and if you have any auxiliary programs the test can
   use. You can create a file with your responses, one response per line, and
   use a command similar to the one shown below to automate running the test
   suite:

 make check < ../cups-1.1.23-testsuite_parms

   This effectively makes the test suite use the responses in the file as the
   input to the questions. Occasionally you may end up doing a bit of trial
   and error determining the exact format of your input file for some things,
   but once figured out and documented you can use this to automate building
   the package.

    Using yes to Automate Input

   Sometimes you will only need to provide one response, or provide the same
   response to many prompts. For these instances, the yes command works
   really well. The yes command can be used to provide a response (the same
   one) to one or more instances of questions. It can be used to simulate
   pressing just the Enter key, entering the Y key or entering a string of
   text. Perhaps the easiest way to show its use is in an example.

   First, create a short Bash script by entering the following commands:

 cat > blfs-yes-test1 << "EOF"
 #!/bin/bash

 echo -n -e "\n\nPlease type something (or nothing) and press Enter ---> "

 read A_STRING

 if test "$A_STRING" = ""; then A_STRING="Just the Enter key was pressed"
 else A_STRING="You entered '$A_STRING'"
 fi

 echo -e "\n\n$A_STRING\n\n"
 EOF
 chmod 755 blfs-yes-test1

   Now run the script by issuing ./blfs-yes-test1 from the command line. It
   will wait for a response, which can be anything (or nothing) followed by
   the Enter key. After entering something, the result will be echoed to the
   screen. Now use the yes command to automate the entering of a response:

 yes | ./blfs-yes-test1

   Notice that piping yes by itself to the script results in y being passed
   to the script. Now try it with a string of text:

 yes 'This is some text' | ./blfs-yes-test1

   The exact string was used as the response to the script. Finally, try it
   using an empty (null) string:

 yes '' | ./blfs-yes-test1

   Notice this results in passing just the press of the Enter key to the
   script. This is useful for times when the default answer to the prompt is
   sufficient. This syntax is used in the Net-tools instructions to accept
   all the defaults to the many prompts during the configuration step. You
   may now remove the test script, if desired.

    File Redirection to Automate Output

   In order to automate the building of some packages, especially those that
   require you to read a license agreement one page at a time, requires using
   a method that avoids having to press a key to display each page.
   Redirecting the output to a file can be used in these instances to assist
   with the automation. The previous section on this page touched on creating
   log files of the build output. The redirection method shown there used the
   tee command to redirect output to a file while also displaying the output
   to the screen. Here, the output will only be sent to a file.

   Again, the easiest way to demonstrate the technique is to show an example.
   First, issue the command:

 ls -l /usr/bin | more

   Of course, you'll be required to view the output one page at a time
   because the more filter was used. Now try the same command, but this time
   redirect the output to a file. The special file /dev/null can be used
   instead of the filename shown, but you will have no log file to examine:

 ls -l /usr/bin | more > redirect_test.log 2>&1

   Notice that this time the command immediately returned to the shell prompt
   without having to page through the output. You may now remove the log
   file.

   The last example will use the yes command in combination with output
   redirection to bypass having to page through the output and then provide a
   y to a prompt. This technique could be used in instances when otherwise
   you would have to page through the output of a file (such as a license
   agreement) and then answer the question of âdo you accept the above?â. For
   this example, another short Bash script is required:

 cat > blfs-yes-test2 << "EOF"
 #!/bin/bash

 ls -l /usr/bin | more

 echo -n -e "\n\nDid you enjoy reading this? (y,n) "

 read A_STRING

 if test "$A_STRING" = "y"; then A_STRING="You entered the 'y' key"
 else A_STRING="You did NOT enter the 'y' key"
 fi

 echo -e "\n\n$A_STRING\n\n"
 EOF
 chmod 755 blfs-yes-test2

   This script can be used to simulate a program that requires you to read a
   license agreement, then respond appropriately to accept the agreement
   before the program will install anything. First, run the script without
   any automation techniques by issuing ./blfs-yes-test2.

   Now issue the following command which uses two automation techniques,
   making it suitable for use in an automated build script:

 yes | ./blfs-yes-test2 > blfs-yes-test2.log 2>&1

   If desired, issue tail blfs-yes-test2.log to see the end of the paged
   output, and confirmation that y was passed through to the script. Once
   satisfied that it works as it should, you may remove the script and log
   file.

   Finally, keep in mind that there are many ways to automate and/or script
   the build commands. There is not a single âcorrectâ way to do it. Your
   imagination is the only limit.

  Dependencies

   For each package described, BLFS lists the known dependencies. These are
   listed under several headings, whose meaning is as follows:

     * Required means that the target package cannot be correctly built
       without the dependency having first been installed.

     * Recommended means that BLFS strongly suggests this package is
       installed first for a clean and trouble-free build, that won't have
       issues either during the build process, or at run-time. The
       instructions in the book assume these packages are installed. Some
       changes or workarounds may be required if these packages are not
       installed.

     * Optional means that this package might be installed for added
       functionality. Often BLFS will describe the dependency to explain the
       added functionality that will result.

  Using the Most Current Package Sources

   On occasion you may run into a situation in the book when a package will
   not build or work properly. Though the Editors attempt to ensure that
   every package in the book builds and works properly, sometimes a package
   has been overlooked or was not tested with this particular version of
   BLFS.

   If you discover that a package will not build or work properly, you should
   see if there is a more current version of the package. Typically this
   means you go to the maintainer's web site and download the most current
   tarball and attempt to build the package. If you cannot determine the
   maintainer's web site by looking at the download URLs, use Google and
   query the package's name. For example, in the Google search bar type:
   'package_name download' (omit the quotes) or something similar. Sometimes
   typing: 'package_name home page' will result in you finding the
   maintainer's web site.

  Stripping One More Time

   In LFS, stripping of debugging symbols was discussed a couple of times.
   When building BLFS packages, there are generally no special instructions
   that discuss stripping again. It is probably not a good idea to strip an
   executable or a library while it is in use, so exiting any windowing
   environment is a good idea. Then you can do:

 find /{,usr/}{bin,lib,sbin} \
     -type f \( -name \*.so* -a ! -name \*dbg \) \
     -exec strip --strip-unneeded {} \;

   If you install programs in other directories such as /opt or /usr/local,
   you may want to strip the files there too.

   For more information on stripping, see
   http://www.technovelty.org/linux/stripping-shared-libraries.html.

  Working with different build systems

   There are now three different build systems in common use for converting C
   or C++ source code into compiled programs or libraries and their details
   (particularly, finding out about available options and their default
   values) differ. It may be easiest to understand the issues caused by some
   choices (typically slow execution or unexpected use of, or omission of,
   optimizatons) by starting with the CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS environment
   variables. There are also some programs which use rust.

   Most LFS and BLFS builders are probably aware of the basics of CFLAGS and
   CXXFLAGS for altering how a program is compiled. Typically, some form of
   optimization is used by upstream developers (-O2 or -O3), sometimes with
   the creation of debug symbols (-g), as defaults.

   If there are contradictory flags (e.g. multiple different -O values), the
   last value will be used. Sometimes this means that flags specified in
   environment variables will be picked up before values hardcoded in the
   Makefile, and therefore ignored. For example, where a user specifies '-O2'
   and that is followed by '-O3' the build will use '-O3'.

   There are various other things which can be passed in CFLAGS or CXXFLAGS,
   such as forcing compilation for a specific microarchitecture (e.g.
   -march=amdfam10, -march=native) or specifying a specific standard for C or
   C++ (-std=c++17 for example). But one thing which has now come to light is
   that programmers might include debug assertions in their code, expecting
   them to be disabled in releases by using -DNDEBUG. Specifically, if
   Mesa-19.1.4 is built with these assertions enabled, some activities such
   as loading levels of games can take extremely long times, even on
   high-class video cards.

    Autotools with Make

   This combination is often described as 'CMMI' (configure, make, make
   install) and is used here to also cover the few packages which have a
   configure script that is not generated by autotools.

   Sometimes running ./configure --help will produce useful options about
   switches which might be used. At other times, after looking at the output
   from configure you may need to look at the details of the script to find
   out what it was actually searching for.

   Many configure scripts will pick up any CFLAGS or CXXFLAGS from the
   environment, but CMMI packages vary about how these will be mixed with any
   flags which would otherwise be used (variously: ignored, used to replace
   the programmer's suggestion, used before the programmer's suggestion, or
   used after the programmer's suggestion).

   In most CMMI packages, running 'make' will list each command and run it,
   interspersed with any warnings. But some packages try to be 'silent' and
   only show which file they are compiling or linking instead of showing the
   command line. If you need to inspect the command, either because of an
   error, or just to see what options and flags are being used, adding 'V=1'
   to the make invocation may help.

    CMake

   CMake works in a very different way, and it has two backends which can be
   used on BLFS: 'make' and 'ninja'. The default backend is make, but ninja
   can be faster on large packages with multiple processors. To use ninja,
   specify '-G Ninja' in the cmake command.

   The hardest part of using CMake is knowing what options you might wish to
   specify. The only way to get a list of what the package knows about is to
   run cmake -LAH and look at the output for that default configuration.

   Perhaps the most-important thing about CMake is that it has a variety of
   CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE values, and these affect the flags. The default is that
   this is not set and no flags are generated. Any CFLAGS or CXXFLAGS in the
   environment will be used. If the programmer has coded any debug
   assertions, those will be enabled unless -DNDEBUG is used. The following
   CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE values will generate the flags shown, and these will come
   after any flags in the environment and therefore take precedence.

     * Debug : '-g'

     * Release : '-O3 -DNDEBUG'

     * RelWithDebInfo : '-O2 -g -DNDEBUG'

     * MinSizeRel : '-Os -DNDEBUG'

   CMake tries to produce quiet builds. To see the details of the commands
   which are being run, use 'make VERBOSE=1' or 'ninja -v'.

    Meson

   Meson has some similarities to CMake, but many differences. To get details
   of the defines that you may wish to change you can look at
   meson_options.txt which is usually in the top-level directory.

   If you have already configured the package by running meson and now wish
   to change one or more settings, you can either remove the build directory,
   recreate it, and use the altered options, or within the build directory
   run meson configure, e.g. to set an option:

 meson configure -D<some_option>=true

   If you do that, the file meson-private/cmd_line.txt will show the last
   commands which were used.

   Meson provides the following buildtype values, and the flags they enable
   come after any flags supplied in the environment and therefore take
   precedence.

     * plain : no added flags. This is for distributors to supply their own
       CLFAGS, CXXFLAGS and LDFLAGS. There is no obvious reason to use this
       in BLFS.

     * debug : '-g'

     * debugoptimized : '-O2 -g' - this is the default if nothing is
       specified, it leaves assertions enabled.

     * release : '-O3 -DNDEBUG' (but occasionally a package will force -O2
       here)

   Although the 'release' buildtype is described as enabling -DNDEBUG, and
   all CMake Release builds pass that, it has so far only been observed (in
   verbose builds) for Mesa-19.1.4. That suggests that it might only be used
   when there are debug assertions present.

   The -DNDEBUG flag can also be provided by passing -Db_ndebug=true.

   To see the details of the commands which are being run in a package using
   meson, use 'ninja -v'.

    Rustc and Cargo

   Most released rustc programs are provided as crates (source tarballs)
   which will query a server to check current versions of dependencies and
   then download them as necessary. These packages are built using cargo
   --release. In theory, you can manipulate the RUSTFLAGS to change the
   optimize-level (default is 3, like -O3, e.g. -Copt-level=3) or to force it
   to build for the machine it is being compiled on, using
   -Ctarget-cpu=native but in practice this seems to make no significant
   difference.

   If you find an interesting rustc program which is only provided as
   unpackaged source, you should at least specify RUSTFLAGS=-Copt-level=2
   otherwise it will do an unoptimized compile with debug info and run much
   slower.

  Optimizing the build

   Many people will prefer to optimize compiles as they see fit, by providing
   CFLAGS or CXXFLAGS. For an introduction to the options available with gcc
   and g++ see https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Optimize-Options.html and
   https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Instrumentation-Options.html and info
   gcc.

   Some packages default to '-O2 -g', others to '-O3 -g', and if CFLAGS or
   CXXFLAGS are supplied they might be added to the package's defaults,
   replace the package's defaults, or even be ignored. There are details on
   some desktop packages which were mostly current in April 2019 at
   http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/~ken/tuning/ - in particular, README.txt,
   tuning-1-packages-and-notes.txt, and tuning-notes-2B.txt. The particular
   thing to remember is that if you want to try some of the more interesting
   flags you may need to force verbose builds to confirm what is being used.

   Clearly, if you are optimizing your own program you can spend time to
   profile it and perhaps recode some of it if it is too slow. But for
   building a whole system that approach is impractical. In general, -O3
   usually produces faster programs than -O2. Specifying -march=native is
   also beneficial, but means that you cannot move the binaries to an
   incompatible machine - this can also apply to newer machines, not just to
   older machines. For example programs compiled for 'amdfam10' run on old
   Phenoms, Kaveris, and Ryzens : but programs compiled for a Kaveri will not
   run on a Ryzen because certain op-codes are not present. Similarly, if you
   build for a Haswell not everything will run on a SandyBridge.

   There are also various other options which some people claim are
   beneficial. At worst, you get to recompile and test, and then discover
   that in your usage the options do not provide a benefit.

   If building Perl or Python modules, or Qt packages which use qmake, in
   general the CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS used are those which were used by those
   'parent' packages.

  Options for hardening the build

   Even on desktop systems, there are still a lot of exploitable
   vulnerabilities. For many of these, the attack comes via javascript in a
   browser. Often, a series of vulnerabilities are used to gain access to
   data (or sometimes to pwn, i.e. own, the machine and install rootkits).
   Most commercial distros will apply various hardening measures.

   For hardening options which are reasonably cheap, there is some discussion
   in the 'tuning' link above (occasionally, one or more of these options
   might be inappropriate for a package). These options are
   -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2, -fstack-protector=strong, and (for C++)
   -D_GLIBCXX_ASSERTIONS. On modern machines these should only have a little
   impact on how fast things run, and often they will not be noticeable.

   In the past, there was Hardened LFS where gcc (a much older version) was
   forced to use hardening (with options to turn some of it off on a
   per-package basis. What is being covered here is different - first you
   have to make sure that the package is indeed using your added flags and
   not over-riding them.

   The main distros use much more, such as RELRO (Relocation Read Only) and
   perhaps -fstack-clash-protection. You may also encounter the so-called
   'userspace retpoline' (-mindirect-branch=thunk etc.) which is the
   equivalent of the spectre mitigations applied to the linux kernel in late
   2018). The kernel mitigations caused a lot of complaints about lost
   performance, if you have a production server you might wish to consider
   testing that, along with the other available options, to see if
   performance is still sufficient.

   Whilst gcc has many hardening options, clang/LLVM's strengths lie
   elsewhere. Some options which gcc provides are said to be less effective
   in clang/LLVM, others are not available.

The /usr Versus /usr/local Debate

   Should I install XXX in /usr or /usr/local?

   This is a question without an obvious answer for an LFS based system.

   In traditional Unix systems, /usr usually contains files that come with
   the system distribution, and the /usr/local tree is free for the local
   administrator to manage. The only really hard and fast rule is that Unix
   distributions should not touch /usr/local, except perhaps to create the
   basic directories within it.

   With Linux distributions like Red Hat, Debian, etc., a possible rule is
   that /usr is managed by the distribution's package system and /usr/local
   is not. This way the package manager's database knows about every file
   within /usr.

   LFS users build their own system and so deciding where the system ends and
   local files begin is not straightforward. So the choice should be made in
   order to make things easier to administer. There are several reasons for
   dividing files between /usr and /usr/local.

     * On a network of several machines all running LFS, or mixed LFS and
       other Linux distributions, /usr/local could be used to hold packages
       that are common between all the computers in the network. It can be
       NFS mounted or mirrored from a single server. Here local indicates
       local to the site.

     * On a network of several computers all running an identical LFS system,
       /usr/local could hold packages that are different between the
       machines. In this case local refers to the individual computers.

     * Even on a single computer, /usr/local can be useful if you have
       several distributions installed simultaneously, and want a place to
       put packages that will be the same on all of them.

     * Or you might regularly rebuild your LFS, but want a place to put files
       that you don't want to rebuild each time. This way you can wipe the
       LFS file system and start from a clean partition every time without
       losing everything.

   Some people ask why not use your own directory tree, e.g., /usr/site,
   rather than /usr/local?

   There is nothing stopping you, many sites do make their own trees, however
   it makes installing new software more difficult. Automatic installers
   often look for dependencies in /usr and /usr/local, and if the file it is
   looking for is in /usr/site instead, the installer will probably fail
   unless you specifically tell it where to look.

   What is the BLFS position on this?

   All of the BLFS instructions install programs in /usr with optional
   instructions to install into /opt for some specific packages.

Optional Patches

   As you follow the various sections in the book, you will observe that the
   book occasionally includes patches that are required for a successful and
   secure installation of the packages. The general policy of the book is to
   include patches that fall in one of the following criteria:

     * Fixes a compilation problem.

     * Fixes a security problem.

     * Fixes a broken functionality.

   In short, the book only includes patches that are either required or
   recommended. There is a Patches subproject which hosts various patches
   (including the patches referenced in the books) to enable you to configure
   your LFS the way you like it.

BLFS Boot Scripts

   The BLFS Bootscripts package contains the init scripts that are used
   throughout the book. It is assumed that you will be using the BLFS
   Bootscripts package in conjunction with a compatible LFS-Bootscripts
   package. Refer to ../../../../lfs/view/9.0/chapter07/bootscripts.html for
   more information on the LFS-Bootscripts package.

   Package Information

     * Download:
       http://anduin.linuxfromscratch.org/BLFS/blfs-bootscripts/blfs-bootscripts-20190609.tar.xz

   The BLFS Bootscripts package will be used throughout the BLFS book for
   startup scripts. Unlike LFS, each init script has a separate install
   target in the BLFS Bootscripts package. It is recommended you keep the
   package source directory around until completion of your BLFS system. When
   a script is requested from BLFS Bootscripts, simply change to the
   directory and as the root user, execute the given make
   install-<init-script> command. This command installs the init script to
   its proper location (along with any auxiliary configuration scripts) and
   also creates the appropriate symlinks to start and stop the service at the
   appropriate run-level.

  Note

   You should review each bootscript before installation to ascertain that it
   satisfies your need. Also verify that the start and stop symlinks it
   creates match your preferences.

  Note

   From time to time the bootscripts are updated to accommodate new packages
   or to make minor corrections. All versions of the bootscripts are located
   at http://anduin.linuxfromscratch.org/BLFS/blfs-bootscripts/.

About Libtool Archive (.la) files

  Files with a .la extention

   In LFS we installed a package, libtool, that is used by many packages to
   build on a variety of Unix platforms. This includes platforms such as AIX,
   Solaris, IRIX, HP-UX, and Cygwin as well as Linux. The origins of this
   tool are quite dated. It was intended to manage libraries on systems with
   less advanced capabilities than a modern Linux system.

   On a Linux system, libtool specific files are generally unneeded. Normally
   libraries are specified in the build process during the link phase. Since
   a linux system uses the Executable and Linkable Format (ELF) for
   executables and libraries, information needed to complete the task is
   embedded in the files. At run time the program loader can query the
   appropriate files and properly load and execute the program.

   The problem is that libtool usually creates one or more text files for
   package libraries called libtool archives. These small files have a ".la"
   extention and contain information that is similar to that embedded in the
   libraries. When building a package that uses libtool, the process
   automatically looks for these files. If a package is updated and no longer
   uses the .la file, then the build process can break.

   The solution is to remove the .la files. However there is a catch. Some
   packages, such as ImageMagick-7.0.8-60, use a libtool function, lt_dlopen,
   to load libraries as needed during execution and resolve their
   dependencies at run time. In this case, the .la files should remain.

   The script below, removes all unneeded .la files and saves them in a
   directory, /var/local/la-files by default, not in the normal library path.
   It also searches all pkg-config files (.pc) for embedded references to .la
   files and fixes them to be conventional library references needed when an
   application or library is built. It can be run as needed to clean up the
   directories that may be causing problems.

Libraries: Static or shared?

  Libraries: Static or shared?

   The original libraries were simply an archive of routines from which the
   required routines were extracted and linked into the executable program.
   These are described as static libraries (libfoo.a). On some old operating
   systems they are the only type available.

   On almost all Linux platforms there are also shared libraries (libfoo.so)
   - one copy of the library is loaded into virtual memory, and shared by all
   the programs which call any of its functions. This is space efficient.

   In the past, essential programs such as a shell were often linked
   statically so that some form of minimal recovery system would exist even
   if shared libraries, such as libc.so, became damaged (e.g. moved to
   lost+found after fsck following an unclean shutdown). Nowadays, most
   people use an alternative system install or a Live CD if they have to
   recover. Journaling filesystems also reduce the likelihood of this sort of
   problem.

   Developers, at least while they are developing, often prefer to use static
   versions of the libraries which their code links to.

   Within the book, there are various places where configure switches such as
   --disable-static are employed, and other places where the possibility of
   using system versions of libraries instead of the versions included within
   another package is discussed. The main reason for this is to simplify
   updates of libraries.

   If a package is linked to a dynamic library, updating to a newer library
   version is automatic once the newer library is installed and the program
   is (re)started (provided the library major version is unchanged, e.g.
   going from libfoo.so.2.0 to libfoo.so.2.1. Going to libfoo.so.3 will
   require recompilation - ldd can be used to find which programs use the old
   version). If a program is linked to a static library, the program always
   has to be recompiled. If you know which programs are linked to a
   particular static library, this is merely an annoyance. But usually you
   will not know which programs to recompile.

   Most libraries are shared, but if you do something unusual, such as moving
   a shared library to /lib accidentally breaking the .so symlink in /usr/lib
   while keeping the static library in /lib, the static library will be
   silently linked into the programs which need it.

   One way to identify when a static library is used, is to deal with it at
   the end of the installation of every package. Write a script to find all
   the static libraries in /usr/lib or wherever you are installing to, and
   either move them to another directory so that they are no longer found by
   the linker, or rename them so that libfoo.a becomes e.g. libfoo.a.hidden.
   The static library can then be temporarily restored if it is ever needed,
   and the package needing it can be identified. You may choose to exclude
   some of the static libraries from glibc if you do this (libc_nonshared.a,
   libg.a, libieee.a, libm.a, libpthread_nonshared.a, librpcsvc.a,
   libsupc++.a) to simplify compilation.

   If you use this approach, you may discover that more packages than you
   were expecting use a static library. That was the case with nettle-2.4 in
   its default static-only configuration: It was required by GnuTLS-3.0.19,
   but also linked into package(s) which used GnuTLS, such as
   glib-networking-2.32.3.

   Many packages put some of their common functions into a static library
   which is only used by the programs within the package and, crucially, the
   library is not installed as a standalone library. These internal libraries
   are not a problem - if the package has to be rebuilt to fix a bug or
   vulnerability, nothing else is linked to them.

   When BLFS mentions system libraries, it means shared versions of
   libraries. Some packages such as Firefox-68.0.2 and ghostscript-9.27
   include many other libraries. When they link to them, they link statically
   so this also makes the programs bigger. The version they ship is often
   older than the version used in the system, so it may contain bugs -
   sometimes developers go to the trouble of fixing bugs in their included
   libraries, other times they do not.

   Sometimes, deciding to use system libraries is an easy decision. Other
   times it may require you to alter the system version (e.g. for
   libpng-1.6.37 if used for Firefox-68.0.2). Occasionally, a package ships
   an old library and can no longer link to the current version, but can link
   to an older version. In this case, BLFS will usually just use the shipped
   version. Sometimes the included library is no longer developed separately,
   or its upstream is now the same as the package's upstream and you have no
   other packages which will use it. In those cases, you might decide to use
   the included static library even if you usually prefer to use system
   libraries.

Locale Related Issues

   This page contains information about locale related problems and issues.
   In the following paragraphs you'll find a generic overview of things that
   can come up when configuring your system for various locales. Many (but
   not all) existing locale related problems can be classified and fall under
   one of the headings below. The severity ratings below use the following
   criteria:

     * Critical: The program doesn't perform its main function. The fix would
       be very intrusive, it's better to search for a replacement.

     * High: Part of the functionality that the program provides is not
       usable. If that functionality is required, it's better to search for a
       replacement.

     * Low: The program works in all typical use cases, but lacks some
       functionality normally provided by its equivalents.

   If there is a known workaround for a specific package, it will appear on
   that package's page. For the most recent information about locale related
   issues for individual packages, check the User Notes in the BLFS Wiki.

  The Needed Encoding is Not a Valid Option in the Program

   Severity: Critical

   Some programs require the user to specify the character encoding for their
   input or output data and present only a limited choice of encodings. This
   is the case for the -X option in a2ps-4.14 and Enscript-1.6.6, the
   -input-charset option in unpatched Cdrtools-3.02a09, and the character
   sets offered for display in the menu of Links-2.19. If the required
   encoding is not in the list, the program usually becomes completely
   unusable. For non-interactive programs, it may be possible to work around
   this by converting the document to a supported input character set before
   submitting to the program.

   A solution to this type of problem is to implement the necessary support
   for the missing encoding as a patch to the original program or to find a
   replacement.

  The Program Assumes the Locale-Based Encoding of External Documents

   Severity: High for non-text documents, low for text documents

   Some programs, nano-4.4 or JOE-4.6 for example, assume that documents are
   always in the encoding implied by the current locale. While this
   assumption may be valid for the user-created documents, it is not safe for
   external ones. When this assumption fails, non-ASCII characters are
   displayed incorrectly, and the document may become unreadable.

   If the external document is entirely text based, it can be converted to
   the current locale encoding using the iconv program.

   For documents that are not text-based, this is not possible. In fact, the
   assumption made in the program may be completely invalid for documents
   where the Microsoft Windows operating system has set de facto standards.
   An example of this problem is ID3v1 tags in MP3 files (see the BLFS Wiki
   ID3v1Coding page for more details). For these cases, the only solution is
   to find a replacement program that doesn't have the issue (e.g., one that
   will allow you to specify the assumed document encoding).

   Among BLFS packages, this problem applies to nano-4.4, JOE-4.6, and all
   media players except Audacious-3.10.1.

   Another problem in this category is when someone cannot read the documents
   you've sent them because their operating system is set up to handle
   character encodings differently. This can happen often when the other
   person is using Microsoft Windows, which only provides one character
   encoding for a given country. For example, this causes problems with UTF-8
   encoded TeX documents created in Linux. On Windows, most applications will
   assume that these documents have been created using the default Windows
   8-bit encoding.

   In extreme cases, Windows encoding compatibility issues may be solved only
   by running Windows programs under Wine.

  The Program Uses or Creates Filenames in the Wrong Encoding

   Severity: Critical

   The POSIX standard mandates that the filename encoding is the encoding
   implied by the current LC_CTYPE locale category. This information is
   well-hidden on the page which specifies the behavior of Tar and Cpio
   programs. Some programs get it wrong by default (or simply don't have
   enough information to get it right). The result is that they create
   filenames which are not subsequently shown correctly by ls, or they refuse
   to accept filenames that ls shows properly. For the GLib-2.60.6 library,
   the problem can be corrected by setting the G_FILENAME_ENCODING
   environment variable to the special "@locale" value. Glib2 based programs
   that don't respect that environment variable are buggy.

   The Zip-3.0 and UnZip-6.0 have this problem because they hard-code the
   expected filename encoding. UnZip contains a hard-coded conversion table
   between the CP850 (DOS) and ISO-8859-1 (UNIX) encodings and uses this
   table when extracting archives created under DOS or Microsoft Windows.
   However, this assumption only works for those in the US and not for anyone
   using a UTF-8 locale. Non-ASCII characters will be mangled in the
   extracted filenames.

   The general rule for avoiding this class of problems is to avoid
   installing broken programs. If this is impossible, the convmv command-line
   tool can be used to fix filenames created by these broken programs, or
   intentionally mangle the existing filenames to meet the broken
   expectations of such programs.

   In other cases, a similar problem is caused by importing filenames from a
   system using a different locale with a tool that is not locale-aware
   (e.g., OpenSSH-8.0p1). In order to avoid mangling non-ASCII characters
   when transferring files to a system with a different locale, any of the
   following methods can be used:

     * Transfer anyway, fix the damage with convmv.

     * On the sending side, create a tar archive with the --format=posix
       switch passed to tar (this will be the default in a future version of
       tar).

     * Mail the files as attachments. Mail clients specify the encoding of
       attached filenames.

     * Write the files to a removable disk formatted with a FAT or FAT32
       filesystem.

     * Transfer the files using Samba.

     * Transfer the files via FTP using RFC2640-aware server (this currently
       means only wu-ftpd, which has bad security history) and client (e.g.,
       lftp).

   The last four methods work because the filenames are automatically
   converted from the sender's locale to UNICODE and stored or sent in this
   form. They are then transparently converted from UNICODE to the
   recipient's locale encoding.

  The Program Breaks Multibyte Characters or Doesn't Count Character Cells
  Correctly

   Severity: High or critical

   Many programs were written in an older era where multibyte locales were
   not common. Such programs assume that C "char" data type, which is one
   byte, can be used to store single characters. Further, they assume that
   any sequence of characters is a valid string and that every character
   occupies a single character cell. Such assumptions completely break in
   UTF-8 locales. The visible manifestation is that the program truncates
   strings prematurely (i.e., at 80 bytes instead of 80 characters).
   Terminal-based programs don't place the cursor correctly on the screen,
   don't react to the "Backspace" key by erasing one character, and leave
   junk characters around when updating the screen, usually turning the
   screen into a complete mess.

   Fixing this kind of problems is a tedious task from a programmer's point
   of view, like all other cases of retrofitting new concepts into the old
   flawed design. In this case, one has to redesign all data structures in
   order to accommodate to the fact that a complete character may span a
   variable number of "char"s (or switch to wchar_t and convert as needed).
   Also, for every call to the "strlen" and similar functions, find out
   whether a number of bytes, a number of characters, or the width of the
   string was really meant. Sometimes it is faster to write a program with
   the same functionality from scratch.

   Among BLFS packages, this problem applies to xine-ui-0.99.10 and all the
   shells.

  The Package Installs Manual Pages in Incorrect or Non-Displayable Encoding

   Severity: Low

   LFS expects that manual pages are in the language-specific (usually 8-bit)
   encoding, as specified on the LFS Man DB page. However, some packages
   install translated manual pages in UTF-8 encoding (e.g., Shadow, already
   dealt with), or manual pages in languages not in the table. Not all BLFS
   packages have been audited for conformance with the requirements put in
   LFS (the large majority have been checked, and fixes placed in the book
   for packages known to install non-conforming manual pages). If you find a
   manual page installed by any of BLFS packages that is obviously in the
   wrong encoding, please remove or convert it as needed, and report this to
   BLFS team as a bug.

   You can easily check your system for any non-conforming manual pages by
   copying the following short shell script to some accessible location,

 #!/bin/sh
 # Begin checkman.sh
 # Usage: find /usr/share/man -type f | xargs checkman.sh
 for a in "$@"
 do
     # echo "Checking $a..."
     # Pure-ASCII manual page (possibly except comments) is OK
     grep -v '.\\"' "$a" | iconv -f US-ASCII -t US-ASCII >/dev/null 2>&1 \
         && continue
     # Non-UTF-8 manual page is OK
     iconv -f UTF-8 -t UTF-8 "$a" >/dev/null 2>&1 || continue
     # Found a UTF-8 manual page, bad.
     echo "UTF-8 manual page: $a" >&2
 done
 # End checkman.sh

   and then issuing the following command (modify the command below if the
   checkman.sh script is not in your PATH environment variable):

 find /usr/share/man -type f | xargs checkman.sh

   Note that if you have manual pages installed in any location other than
   /usr/share/man (e.g., /usr/local/share/man), you must modify the above
   command to include this additional location.

Going Beyond BLFS

   The packages that are installed in this book are only the tip of the
   iceberg. We hope that the experience you gained with the LFS book and the
   BLFS book will give you the background needed to compile, install and
   configure packages that are not included in this book.

   When you want to install a package to a location other than /, or /usr,
   you are installing outside the default environment settings on most
   machines. The following examples should assist you in determining how to
   correct this situation. The examples cover the complete range of settings
   that may need updating, but they are not all needed in every situation.

     * Expand the PATH to include $PREFIX/bin.

     * Expand the PATH for root to include $PREFIX/sbin.

     * Add $PREFIX/lib to /etc/ld.so.conf or expand LD_LIBRARY_PATH to
       include it. Before using the latter option, check out
       http://xahlee.org/UnixResource_dir/_/ldpath.html. If you modify
       /etc/ld.so.conf, remember to update /etc/ld.so.cache by executing
       ldconfig as the root user.

     * Add $PREFIX/man to /etc/man_db.conf or expand MANPATH.

     * Add $PREFIX/info to INFOPATH.

     * Add $PREFIX/lib/pkgconfig to PKG_CONFIG_PATH. Some packages are now
       installing .pc files in $PREFIX/share/pkgconfig, so you may have to
       include this directory also.

     * Add $PREFIX/include to CPPFLAGS when compiling packages that depend on
       the package you installed.

     * Add $PREFIX/lib to LDFLAGS when compiling packages that depend on a
       library installed by the package.

   If you are in search of a package that is not in the book, the following
   are different ways you can search for the desired package.

     * If you know the name of the package, then search Freecode for it at
       http://freecode.com/. Also search Google at http://google.com/.
       Sometimes a search for the rpm at http://rpmfind.net/ or the deb at
       http://www.debian.org/distrib/packages#search_packages can also lead
       to a link to the package.

     * If you know the name of the executable, but not the package that the
       executable belongs to, first try a Google search with the name of the
       executable. If the results are overwhelming, try searching for the
       given executable in the Debian repository at
       http://www.debian.org/distrib/packages#search_contents.

   Some general hints on handling new packages:

     * Many of the newer packages follow the ./configure && make && make
       install process. Help on the options accepted by configure can be
       obtained via the command ./configure --help.

     * Most of the packages contain documentation on compiling and installing
       the package. Some of the documents are excellent, some not so
       excellent. Check out the homepage of the package for any additional
       and updated hints for compiling and configuring the package.

     * If you are having a problem compiling the package, try searching the
       LFS archives at http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/search.html for the
       error or if that fails, try searching Google. Often, a distribution
       will have already solved the problem (many of them use development
       versions of packages, so they see the changes sooner than those of us
       who normally use stable released versions). But be cautious - all
       builders tend to carry patches which are no longer necessary, and to
       have fixes which are only required because of their particular choices
       in how they build a package. You may have to search deeply to find a
       fix for the package version you are trying to use, or even to find the
       package (names are sometimes not what you might expect, e.g.
       ghostscript often has a prefix or a suffix in its name), but the
       following notes might help, particularly for those who, like the
       editors, are trying to build the latest versions and encountering
       problems:

          * Arch http://www.archlinux.org/packages/ - enter the package name
            in the 'Keywords' box, select the package name, select the
            'Source Files' field, and then select the PKGBUILD entry to see
            how they build this package.

          * Debian ftp://ftp.uk.debian.org/debian/pool (use your country's
            version if there is one) - the source will be in .tar.gz tarballs
            (either the original upstream .orig source, or else a dfsg
            containing those parts which comply with debian's free software
            guidelines) accompanied by versioned .diff.gz or .tar.gz
            additions. These additions often show how the package is built,
            and may contain patches. In the .diff.gz versions, any patches
            create files in debian/patches.

          * Fedora packages are now most-conveniently accessed by downloading
            an srpm (source rpm) and using rpm2cpio (see the Tip at the
            bottom of the page. Go to
            https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/fedora/linux/ and then choose
            which repo you wish to look at - development/rawhide is the
            latest development, or choose releases for what was shipped in a
            release, updates for updates to a release, or updates/testing for
            the latest updates which might work or might have problems.

          * Gentoo - the mirrors for ebuilds and patches seem to be
            well-hidden, and they change frequently. Also, if you have found
            a mirror, you need to know which directory the application has
            been assigned to. The ebuilds themselves can be found at
            http://packages.gentoo.org/ - use the search field. If there are
            any patches, a mirror will have them in the files/ directory.
            Depending on your browser, or the mirror, you might need to
            download the ebuild to be able to read it. Treat the ebuild as a
            sort of pseudo-code / shell combination - look in particular for
            sed commands and patches, or hazard a guess at the meanings of
            the functions such as dodoc.

          * openSUSE provide a rolling release, some package versions are in
            http://download.opensuse.org/source/tumbleweed/repo/oss/src/ but
            others are in ../update/openSUSE-current/src - the source only
            seems to be available in source rpms.

          * Slackware - the official package browser is currently broken. The
            site at http://slackbuilds.org/ has current and previous versions
            in their unofficial repository with links to homepages,
            downloads, and some individual files, particularly the
            .SlackBuild files.

          * Ubuntu ftp://ftp.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/ - see the debian notes
            above.

       If everything else fails, try the blfs-support mailing-list.

  Tip

   If you have found a package that is only available in .deb or .rpm format,
   there are two small scripts, rpm2targz and deb2targz that are available at
   http://downloads.linuxfromscratch.org/deb2targz.tar.bz2 and
   http://downloads.linuxfromscratch.org/rpm2targz.tar.bz2 to convert the
   archives into a simple tar.gz format.

   You may also find an rpm2cpio script useful. The Perl version in the linux
   kernel archives at
   http://lkml.indiana.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0210.2/att-0093/01-rpm2cpio
   works for most source rpms. The rpm2targz script will use an rpm2cpio
   script or binary if one is on your path. Note that rpm2cpio will unpack a
   source rpm in the current directory, giving a tarball, a spec file, and
   perhaps patches or other files.

               Part II. Post LFS Configuration and Extra Software

Chapter 3. After LFS Configuration Issues

   The intention of LFS is to provide a basic system which you can build
   upon. There are several things about tidying up the system which many
   people wonder about once they have done the base install. We hope to cover
   these issues in this chapter.

   Most people coming from non-Unix like backgrounds to Linux find the
   concept of text-only configuration files slightly strange. In Linux, just
   about all configuration is done via the manipulation of text files. The
   majority of these files can be found in the /etc hierarchy. There are
   often graphical configuration programs available for different subsystems
   but most are simply pretty front ends to the process of editing a text
   file. The advantage of text-only configuration is that you can edit
   parameters using your favorite text editor, whether that be vim, emacs, or
   any other editor.

   The first task is making a recovery boot device in Creating a Custom Boot
   Device because it's the most critical need. Hardware issues relevant to
   firmware and other devices is addressed next. The system is then
   configured to ease addition of new users, because this can affect the
   choices you make in the two subsequent topicsâThe Bash Shell Startup Files
   and The vimrc Files.

   The remaining topics, Customizing your Logon with /etc/issue, Random
   number generation, and Autofs-5.1.5 are then addressed, in that order.
   They don't have much interaction with the other topics in this chapter.

Creating a Custom Boot Device

  Decent Rescue Boot Device Needs

   This section is really about creating a rescue device. As the name rescue
   implies, the host system has a problem, often lost partition information
   or corrupted file systems, that prevents it from booting and/or operating
   normally. For this reason, you must not depend on resources from the host
   being "rescued". To presume that any given partition or hard drive will be
   available is a risky presumption.

   In a modern system, there are many devices that can be used as a rescue
   device: floppy, cdrom, usb drive, or even a network card. Which one you
   use depends on your hardware and your BIOS. In the past, a rescue device
   was thought to be a floppy disk. Today, many systems do not even have a
   floppy drive.

   Building a complete rescue device is a challenging task. In many ways, it
   is equivalent to building an entire LFS system. In addition, it would be a
   repetition of information already available. For these reasons, the
   procedures for a rescue device image are not presented here.

  Creating a Rescue Floppy

   The software of today's systems has grown large. Linux 2.6 no longer
   supports booting directly from a floppy. In spite of this, there are
   solutions available using older versions of Linux. One of the best is
   Tom's Root/Boot Disk available at http://www.toms.net/rb/. This will
   provide a minimal Linux system on a single floppy disk and provides the
   ability to customize the contents of your disk if necessary.

  Creating a Bootable CD-ROM

   There are several sources that can be used for a rescue CD-ROM. Just about
   any commercial distribution's installation CD-ROMs or DVDs will work.
   These include RedHat, Ubuntu, and SuSE. One very popular option is
   Knoppix.

   Also, the LFS Community has developed its own LiveCD available at
   http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/livecd/. This LiveCD, is no longer capable
   of building an entire LFS/BLFS system, but is still a good rescue CD-ROM.
   If you download the ISO image, use xorriso to copy the image to a CD-ROM.

   The instructions for using GRUB2 to make a custom rescue CD-ROM are also
   available in LFS Chapter 8.

  Creating a Bootable USB Drive

   A USB Pen drive, sometimes called a Thumb drive, is recognized by Linux as
   a SCSI device. Using one of these devices as a rescue device has the
   advantage that it is usually large enough to hold more than a minimal boot
   image. You can save critical data to the drive as well as use it to
   diagnose and recover a damaged system. Booting such a drive requires BIOS
   support, but building the system consists of formatting the drive, adding
   GRUB as well as the Linux kernel and supporting files.

About Console Fonts

   An LFS system can be used without a graphical desktop, and unless or until
   you install X Window System you will have to work in the console. Most, if
   not all, PCs boot with an 8x16 font - whatever the actual screen size.
   There are a few things you can do to alter the display on the console.
   Most of them involve changing the font, but the first alters the
   commandline used by grub.

   User Notes: http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/aboutconsolefonts

  Setting a smaller screen size in grub

   Modern screens often have a lot more pixels then the screens used in the
   past. If your screen is 1600 pixels wide, an 8x16 font will give you 200
   columns of text - unless your monitor is enormous, the text will be tiny.
   One of the ways to work around this is to tell grub to use a smaller size,
   such as 1024x768 or 800x600 or even 640x480. Even if your screen does not
   have a 4:3 aspect ratio, this should work.

   To try this, you can reboot and edit grub's command-line to insert a
   'video=' parameter between the 'root=/dev/sdXn' and 'ro', for example
   root=/dev/sda2 video=1024x768 ro based on the example in LFS section 8.4.4
   : ../../../../lfs/view/9.0/chapter08/grub.html .

   If you decide that you wish to do this, you can then (as the root user)
   edit /boot/grub/grub.cfg.

  Using the standard psf fonts

   In LFS the kbd package is used. The fonts it provides are PC Screen Fonts,
   usually called PSF, and they were installed into /usr/share/consolefonts.
   Where these include a unicode mapping table, the file suffix is often
   changed to .psfu although packages such as terminus-font (see below) do
   not add the 'u'. These fonts are usually compressed with gzip to save
   space, but that is not essential.

   The initial PC text screens had 8 colours, or 16 colours if the bright
   versions of the original 8 colours were used. A PSF font can include up to
   256 characters (technically, glyphs) while allowing 16 colours, or up to
   512 characters (in which case, the bright colours will not be available).
   Clearly, these console fonts cannot be used to display CJK text - that
   would need thousands of available glyphs.

   Some fonts in kbd can cover more than 512 codepoints ('characters'), with
   varying degrees of fidelity: unicode contains several whitespace
   codepoints which can all be mapped to a space, varieties of dashes can be
   mapped to a minus sign, smart quotes can map to the regular ASCII quotes
   rather than to whatever is used for "codepoint not present or invalid",
   and those cyrillic or greek letters which look like latin letters can be
   mapped onto them, so 'A' can also do duty for cyrillic A and greek Alpha,
   and 'P' can also do duty for cyrillic ER and greek RHO. Unfortunately,
   where a font has been created from a BDF file (the method in terminus and
   debian's console-setup ) such mapping of additional codepoints onto an
   existing glyph is not always done, although the terminus ter-vXXn fonts do
   this well.

   There are over 120 combinations of font and size in kbd: often a font is
   provided at several character sizes, and sometimes varieties cover
   different subsets of unicode. Most are 8 pixels wide, in heights from 8 to
   16 pixels, but there are a few which are 9 pixels wide, some others which
   are 12x22, and even one (latarcyrheb-sun32.psfu) which has been scaled up
   to 16x32. Using a bigger font is another way of making text on a large
   screen easier to read.

  Testing different fonts

   You can test fonts as a normal user. If you have a font which has not been
   installed, you can load it with :

 setfont /path/to/yourfont.ext

   For the fonts already installed you only need the name, so using
   gr737a-9x16.psfu.gz as an example:

 setfont gr737a-9x16

   To see the glyphs in the font, use:

 showconsolefont

   If the font looks as if it might be useful, you can then go on to test it
   more thoroughly.

   When you find a font which you wish to use, as the root user) edit
   /etc/sysconfig/console as described in LFS section 7.6.5
   ../../../../lfs/view/9.0/chapter07/usage.html. .

   For fonts not supplied with the kbd package you will need to optionally
   compress it / them with gzip and then install it / them as the root user.

  Editing fonts using psf-tools

   Although some console fonts are created from BDF files, which is a text
   format with hex values for the pixels in each row of the character, there
   are more-modern tools available for editing psf fonts. The psftools
   package allows you to dump a font to a text representation with a dash for
   a pixel which is off (black) and a hash for a pixel which is on (white).
   You can then edit the text file to add more characters, or reshape them,
   or map extra codepoints onto them, and then create a new psf font with
   your changes.

  Using fonts from Terminus-font

   The Terminus Font package provides fixed-width bitmap fonts designed for
   long (8 hours and more per day) work with computers. Under 'Character
   variants' on that page is a list of patches (in the alt/ directory). If
   you are using a graphical browser to look at that page, you can see what
   the patches do, e.g. 'll2' makes 'l' more visibly different from 'i' and
   '1'.

   By default terminus-fonts will try to create several types of font, and it
   will fail if bdftopcf from Xorg Applications has not been installed. The
   configure script is only really useful if you go on to install all the
   fonts (console and X11 bitmap) to the correct directories, as in a distro.
   To build only the PSF fonts and their dependencies, run:

 make psf

   This will create more than 240 ter-*.psf fonts. The 'b' suffix indicates
   bright, 'n' indicates normal. You can then test them to see if any fit
   your requirements. Unless you are creating a distro, there seems little
   point in installing them all.

   As an example, to install the last of these fonts, you can gzip it and
   then as the root user:

 install -v -m644 ter-v32n.psf.gz /usr/share/consolefonts

About Firmware

   On some recent PCs it can be necessary, or desirable, to load firmware to
   make them work at their best. There is a directory, /lib/firmware, where
   the kernel or kernel drivers look for firmware images.

   Preparing firmware for multiple different machines, as a distro would do,
   is outside the scope of this book.

   Currently, most firmware can be found at a git repository:
   http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/firmware/linux-firmware.git/tree/.
   For convenience, the LFS Project has created a mirror, updated daily,
   where these firmware files can be accessed via wget or a web browser at
   http://anduin.linuxfromscratch.org/BLFS/linux-firmware/.

   To get the firmware, either point a browser to one of the above
   repositories and then download the item(s) which you need, or install git
   and clone that repository.

   For some other firmware, particularly for Intel microcode and certain wifi
   devices, the needed firmware is not available in the above repository.
   Some of this will be addressed below, but a search of the Internet for
   needed firmware is sometimes necessary.

   Firmware files are conventionally referred to as blobs because you cannot
   determine what they will do. Note that firmware is distributed under
   various different licenses which do not permit disassembly or
   reverse-engineering.

   Firmware for PCs falls into four categories:

     * Updates to the CPU to work around errata, usually referred to as
       microcode.

     * Firmware for video controllers. On x86 machines this seems to mostly
       apply to ATI devices (Radeon and AMDGPU chips) and Nvidia Maxwell and
       Pascal cards which all require firmware to be able to use KMS (kernel
       modesetting - the preferred option) as well as for Xorg. For earlier
       radeon chips (before the R600), the firmware is still in the kernel.

     * Firmware updates for wired network ports. Mostly they work even
       without the updates, but probably they will work better with the
       updated firmware. For some modern laptops, firmware for both wired
       ethernet (e.g. rtl_nic) and also for bluetooth devices (e.g. qca) is
       required before the wired network can be used.

     * Firmware for other devices, such as wifi. These devices are not
       required for the PC to boot, but need the firmware before these
       devices can be used.

  Note

   Although not needed to load a firmware blob, the following tools may be
   useful for determining, obtaining, or preparing the needed firmware in
   order to load it into the system: cpio-2.12, git-2.23.0, pciutils-3.6.2,
   and Wget-1.20.3

   User Notes: http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/aboutfirmware

  Microcode updates for CPUs

   In general, microcode can be loaded by the BIOS or UEFI, and it might be
   updated by upgrading to a newer version of those. On linux, you can also
   load the microcode from the kernel if you are using an AMD family 10h or
   later processor (first introduced late 2007), or an Intel processor from
   1998 and later (Pentium4, Core, etc), if updated microcode has been
   released. These updates only last until the machine is powered off, so
   they need to be applied on every boot.

   Intel provide updates of their microcode for SandyBridge and later
   processors as new vulnerabilities come to light. New versions of AMD
   firmware are rare and usually only apply to a few models, although
   motherboard manufacturers get extra updates which maybe update microcode
   along with the changes to support newer CPUs and faster memory.

   There are two ways of loading the microcode, described as 'early' and
   'late'. Early loading happens before userspace has been started, late
   loading happens after userspace has started. Not surprisingly, early
   loading is preferred, (see e.g. an explanatory comment in a kernel commit
   noted at x86/microcode: Early load microcode on LWN.) Indeed, it is needed
   to work around one particular erratum in early Intel Haswell processors
   which had TSX enabled. (See Intel Disables TSX Instructions: Erratum Found
   in Haswell, Haswell-E/EP, Broadwell-Y.) Without this update glibc can do
   the wrong thing in uncommon situations.

   It is still possible to manually force late loading of microcode, either
   for testing or to prevent having to reboot. You will need to reconfigure
   your kernel for either method. The instructions here will create a kernel
   .config to suite early loading, before forcing late loading to see if
   there is any microcode. If there is, the instructions then show you how to
   create an initrd for early loading.

   To confirm what processor(s) you have (if more than one, they will be
   identical) look in /proc/cpuinfo.

    Intel Microcode for the CPU

   The first step is to get the most recent version of the Intel microcode.
   This must be done by navigating to
   https://github.com/intel/Intel-Linux-Processor-Microcode-Data-Files/releases/
   and downloading the latest file there. As of this writing the most recent
   version of the microcode is microcode-20190514a. Extract this file in the
   normal way, the microcode is in the intel-ucode directory, containing
   various blobs with names in the form XX-YY-ZZ. There are also various
   other files, and a releasenote.

   In the past, intel did not provide any details of which blobs had changed
   versions, but now the releasenote details this.

   The recent firmware for older processors is provided to deal with
   vulnerabilities which have now been made public, and for some of these
   such as Microarchitectural Data Sampling (MDS) you might wish to increase
   the protection by disabling hyperthreading, or alternatively to disable
   the kernel's default mitigation because of its impact on compile times.
   Please read the online documentation at
   https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/hw-vuln/index.html.

   To be able to use the microcode which addresses MDS, the kernel must be
   one of the following stable versions: 5.1.2, 5.0.16, 4.19.43, 4.14.119,
   4.9.176 or a later version of those series, or a later kernel series such
   as 5.2.

   Now you need to determine your processor's identity to see if there is any
   microcode for it. Determine the decimal values of the cpu family, model
   and stepping by running the following command (it will also report the
   current microcode version):

 head -n7 /proc/cpuinfo

   Convert the cpu family, model and stepping to pairs of hexadecimal digits.
   For a Haswell i7-4790 (described as Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-4790 CPU) the
   relevant values are cpu family 6, model 60, stepping 3 so in this case the
   required identification is 06-3c-03. A look at the blobs will show that
   there is one for this CPU (although it might have already been applied by
   the BIOS). If there is a blob for your system then test if it will be
   applied by copying it (replace <XX-YY-ZZ> by the identifier for your
   machine) to where the kernel can find it:

 mkdir -pv /lib/firmware/intel-ucode
 cp -v intel-ucode/<XX-YY-ZZ> /lib/firmware/intel-ucode

   Now that the Intel microcode has been prepared, use the following options
   when you configure the kernel to load Intel microcode:

 General Setup --->
   [y] Initial RAM filesystem and RAM disk (initramfs/initrd) support [CONFIG_BLK_DEV_INITRD]
 Processor type and features  --->
   [y] CPU microcode loading support  [CONFIG_MICROCODE]
   [y]      Intel microcode loading support [CONFIG_MICROCODE_INTEL]

   After you have successfully booted the new system, force late loading by
   using the command:

 echo 1 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/microcode/reload

   Then use the following command to see if anything was loaded:

 dmesg | grep -e 'microcode' -e 'Linux version' -e 'Command line'

   This old example (from before Intel provided details of the latest
   versions) from the Haswell i7 which was released in Q2 2014 and is not
   affected by the TSX errata shows it has been updated from revision 0x19 in
   the BIOS/UEFI (which this version of the kernel now complains about) to
   revision 0x24. Unlike in older kernels, the individual CPUs are not
   separately reported:

 [    0.000000] Linux version 4.18.0-rc8 (root@plexi) (gcc version 8.2.0 (GCC))

   If the microcode was not updated, there is no new microcode for this
   system's processor. If it did get updated, you can now proceed to the
   section called âEarly loading of microcodeâ.

    AMD Microcode for the CPU

   Begin by downloading a container of firmware for your CPU family from
   http://anduin.linuxfromscratch.org/BLFS/linux-firmware/amd-ucode/. The
   family is always specified in hex. Families 10h to 14h (16 to 20) are in
   microcode_amd.bin. Families 15h, 16h and 17h have their own containers.
   Create the required directory and put the firmware you downloaded into it
   as the root user:

 mkdir -pv /lib/firmware/amd-ucode
 cp -v microcode_amd* /lib/firmware/amd-ucode

   When you configure the kernel, use the following options to load AMD
   microcode:

 General Setup --->
   [y] Initial RAM filesystem and RAM disk (initramfs/initrd) support [CONFIG_BLK_DEV_INITRD]
 Processor type and features  --->
   [y] CPU microcode loading support  [CONFIG_MICROCODE]
   [y]      AMD microcode loading support [CONFIG_MICROCODE_AMD]

   After you have successfully booted the new system, force late loading by
   using the command:

 echo 1 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/microcode/reload

   Then use the following command to see if anything was loaded:

 dmesg | grep -e 'microcode' -e 'Linux version' -e 'Command line'

   This historic example from an old Athlon(tm) II X2 shows it has been
   updated. At that time, all CPUs were still reported in the microcode
   details on AMD machines (the current position for AMD machines where newer
   microcode is available is unknown) :

 [    0.000000] Linux version 4.15.3 (ken@testserver) (gcc version 7.3.0 (GCC))
                #1 SMP Sun Feb 18 02:08:12 GMT 2018

 [  187.928899] microcode: CPU1: new patch_level=0x010000c8

   If the microcode was not updated, there is no new microcode for this
   system's processor. If it did get updated, you can now proceed to the
   section called âEarly loading of microcodeâ.

    Early loading of microcode

   If you have established that updated microcode is available for your
   system, it is time to prepare it for early loading. This requires an
   additional package, cpio-2.12 and the creation of an initrd which will
   need to be added to grub.cfg.

   It does not matter where you prepare the initrd, and once it is working
   you can apply the same initrd to later LFS systems or newer kernels on
   this same machine, at least until any newer microcode is released. Use the
   following commands:

 mkdir -p initrd/kernel/x86/microcode
 cd initrd

   For an AMD machine, use the following command (replace <MYCONTAINER> with
   the name of the container for your CPU's family):

 cp -v /lib/firmware/amd-ucode/<MYCONTAINER> kernel/x86/microcode/AuthenticAMD.bin

   Or for an Intel machine copy the appropriate blob using this command:

 cp -v /lib/firmware/intel-ucode/<XX-YY-ZZ> kernel/x86/microcode/GenuineIntel.bin

   Now prepare the initrd:

 find . | cpio -o -H newc > /boot/microcode.img

   You now need to add a new entry to /boot/grub/grub.cfg and here you should
   add a new line after the linux line within the stanza. If /boot is a
   separate mountpoint:

 initrd /microcode.img

   or this if it is not:

 initrd /boot/microcode.img

   If you are already booting with an initrd (see the section called âAbout
   initramfsâ) you must specify the microcode initrd first, using a line such
   as initrd /microcode.img /other-initrd.img (adapt that as above if /boot
   is not a separate mountpoint).

   You can now reboot with the added initrd, and then use the same command to
   check that the early load worked.

 dmesg | grep -e 'microcode' -e 'Linux version' -e 'Command line'

   If you updated to address vulnerabilities, you can look at
   /sys/devices/system/cpu/vulnerabilities/ to see what is now reported.

   The places and times where early loading happens are very different in AMD
   and Intel machines. First, an Intel example from an updated kernel,
   showing that the first notification comes before the kernel version is
   mentioned:

 [    0.000000] microcode: microcode updated early to revision 0x27, date = 2019-02-26

  Firmware for Video Cards

    Firmware for ATI video chips (R600 and later)

   These instructions do NOT apply to old radeons before the R600 family. For
   those, the firmware is in the kernel's /lib/firmware/ directory. Nor do
   they apply if you intend to avoid a graphical setup such as Xorg and are
   content to use the default 80x25 display rather than a framebuffer.

   Early radeon devices only needed a single 2K blob of firmware. Recent
   devices need several different blobs, and some of them are much bigger.
   The total size of the radeon firmware directory is over 500K â on a large
   modern system you can probably spare the space, but it is still redundant
   to install all the unused files each time you build a system.

   A better approach is to install pciutils-3.6.2 and then use lspci to
   identify which VGA controller is installed.

   With that information, check the RadeonFeature page of the Xorg wiki for
   Decoder ring for engineering vs marketing names to identify the family
   (you may need to know this for the Xorg driver in BLFS â Southern Islands
   and Sea Islands use the radeonsi driver) and the specific model.

   Now that you know which controller you are using, consult the Radeon page
   of the Gentoo wiki which has a table listing the required firmware blobs
   for the various chipsets. Note that Southern Islands and Sea Islands chips
   use different firmware for kernel 3.17 and later compared to earlier
   kernels. Identify and download the required blobs then install them:

 mkdir -pv /lib/firmware/radeon
 cp -v <YOUR_BLOBS> /lib/firmware/radeon

   There are actually two ways of installing this firmware. BLFS, in the
   'Kernel Configuration for additional firmware' section part of the Xorg
   ATI Driver-19.0.1 section gives an example of compiling the firmware into
   the kernel - that is slightly faster to load, but uses more kernel memory.
   Here we will use the alternative method of making the radeon driver a
   module. In your kernel config set the following:

 Device Drivers --->
   Graphics support --->
       Direct Rendering Manager --->
         <*> Direct Rendering Manager (XFree86 ... support)  [CONFIG_DRM]
       <m> ATI Radeon                                        [CONFIG_DRM_RADEON]

   Loading several large blobs from /lib/firmware takes a noticeable time,
   during which the screen will be blank. If you do not enable the penguin
   framebuffer logo, or change the console size by using a bigger font, that
   probably does not matter. If desired, you can slightly reduce the time if
   you follow the alternate method of specifying 'y' for CONFIG_DRM_RADEON
   covered in BLFS at the link above â you must specify each needed radeon
   blob if you do that.

    Firmware for Nvidia video chips

   Some Nvidia graphics chips need firmware updates to take advantage of all
   the card's capability. These are generally the GeForce 8, 9, 9300, and
   200-900 series chips. For more exact information, see
   https://nouveau.freedesktop.org/wiki/VideoAcceleration/#firmware.

   First, the kernel Nvidia driver must be activated:

 Device Drivers --->
   Graphics support --->
       Direct Rendering Manager --->
         <*> Direct Rendering Manager (XFree86 ... support)  [CONFIG_DRM]
       <*/m> Nouveau (NVIDIA) cards                          [CONFIG_DRM_NOUVEAU]

   The steps to install the Nvidia firmware are:

 wget https://raw.github.com/imirkin/re-vp2/master/extract_firmware.py
 wget http://us.download.nvidia.com/XFree86/Linux-x86/325.15/NVIDIA-Linux-x86-325.15.run
 sh NVIDIA-Linux-x86-325.15.run --extract-only
 python extract_firmware.py
 mkdir -p /lib/firmware/nouveau
 cp -d nv* vuc-* /lib/firmware/nouveau/

  Firmware for Network Interfaces

   The kernel likes to load firmware for some network drivers, particularly
   those from Realtek (the /lib/linux-firmware/rtl_nic/) directory, but they
   generally appear to work without it. Therefore, you can boot the kernel,
   check dmesg for messages about this missing firmware, and if necessary
   download the firmware and put it in the specified directory in
   /lib/firmware so that it will be found on subsequent boots. Note that with
   current kernels this works whether or not the driver is compiled in or
   built as a module, there is no need to build this firmware into the
   kernel. Here is an example where the R8169 driver has been compiled in but
   the firmware was not made available. Once the firmware had been provided,
   there was no mention of it on later boots.

 dmesg | grep firmware | grep r8169
 [    7.018028] r8169 0000:01:00.0: Direct firmware load for rtl_nic/rtl8168g-2.fw failed with error -2
 [    7.018036] r8169 0000:01:00.0 eth0: unable to load firmware patch rtl_nic/rtl8168g-2.fw (-2)

  Firmware for Other Devices

   Identifying the correct firmware will typically require you to install
   pciutils-3.6.2, and then use lspci to identify the device. You should then
   search online to check which module it uses, which firmware, and where to
   obtain the firmware â not all of it is in linux-firmware.

   If possible, you should begin by using a wired connection when you first
   boot your LFS system. To use a wireless connection you will need to use a
   network tools such as Wireless Tools-29 and wpa_supplicant-2.9.

   Firmware may also be needed for other devices such as some SCSI
   controllers, bluetooth adaptors, or TV recorders. The same principles
   apply.

About Devices

   Although most devices needed by packages in BLFS and beyond are set up
   properly by udev using the default rules installed by LFS in
   /etc/udev/rules.d, there are cases where the rules must be modified or
   augmented.

   User Notes: http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/aboutdevices

  Multiple Sound Cards

   If there are multiple sound cards in a system, the "default" sound card
   becomes random. The method to establish sound card order depends on
   whether the drivers are modules or not. If the sound card drivers are
   compiled into the kernel, control is via kernel command line parameters in
   /boot/grub/grub.cfg. For example, if a system has both an FM801 card and a
   SoundBlaster PCI card, the following can be appended to the command line:

 snd-fm801.index=0 snd-ens1371.index=1

   If the sound card drivers are built as modules, the order can be
   established in the /etc/modprobe.conf file with:

 options snd-fm801 index=0
 options snd-ens1371 index=1

  USB Device Issues

   USB devices usually have two kinds of device nodes associated with them.

   The first kind is created by device-specific drivers (e.g.,
   usb_storage/sd_mod or usblp) in the kernel. For example, a USB mass
   storage device would be /dev/sdb, and a USB printer would be /dev/usb/lp0.
   These device nodes exist only when the device-specific driver is loaded.

   The second kind of device nodes (/dev/bus/usb/BBB/DDD, where BBB is the
   bus number and DDD is the device number) are created even if the device
   doesn't have a kernel driver. By using these "raw" USB device nodes, an
   application can exchange arbitrary USB packets with the device, i.e.,
   bypass the possibly-existing kernel driver.

   Access to raw USB device nodes is needed when a userspace program is
   acting as a device driver. However, for the program to open the device
   successfully, the permissions have to be set correctly. By default, due to
   security concerns, all raw USB devices are owned by user root and group
   usb, and have 0664 permissions (the read access is needed, e.g., for lsusb
   to work and for programs to access USB hubs). Packages (such as SANE and
   libgphoto2) containing userspace USB device drivers also ship udev rules
   that change the permissions of the controlled raw USB devices. That is,
   rules installed by SANE change permissions for known scanners, but not
   printers. If a package maintainer forgot to write a rule for your device,
   report a bug to both BLFS (if the package is there) and upstream, and you
   will need to write your own rule.

   There is one situation when such fine-grained access control with
   pre-generated udev rules doesn't work. Namely, PC emulators such as KVM,
   QEMU and VirtualBox use raw USB device nodes to present arbitrary USB
   devices to the guest operating system (note: patches are needed in order
   to get this to work without the obsolete /proc/bus/usb mount point
   described below). Obviously, maintainers of these packages cannot know
   which USB devices are going to be connected to the guest operating system.
   You can either write separate udev rules for all needed USB devices
   yourself, or use the default catch-all "usb" group, members of which can
   send arbitrary commands to all USB devices.

   Before Linux-2.6.15, raw USB device access was performed not with
   /dev/bus/usb/BBB/DDD device nodes, but with /proc/bus/usb/BBB/DDD
   pseudofiles. Some applications (e.g., VMware Workstation) still use only
   this deprecated technique and can't use the new device nodes. For them to
   work, use the "usb" group, but remember that members will have
   unrestricted access to all USB devices. To create the fstab entry for the
   obsolete usbfs filesystem:

 usbfs  /proc/bus/usb  usbfs  devgid=14,devmode=0660  0  0

  Note

   Adding users to the "usb" group is inherently insecure, as they can bypass
   access restrictions imposed through the driver-specific USB device nodes.
   For instance, they can read sensitive data from USB hard drives without
   being in the "disk" group. Avoid adding users to this group, if you can.

  Udev Device Attributes

   Fine-tuning of device attributes such as group name and permissions is
   possible by creating extra udev rules, matching on something like this.
   The vendor and product can be found by searching the /sys/devices
   directory entries or using udevadm info after the device has been
   attached. See the documentation in the current udev directory of
   /usr/share/doc for details.

 SUBSYSTEM=="usb_device", SYSFS{idVendor}=="05d8", SYSFS{idProduct}=="4002", \
   GROUP:="scanner", MODE:="0660"

  Note

   The above line is used for descriptive purposes only. The scanner udev
   rules are put into place when installing SANE-1.0.27.

  Devices for Servers

   In some cases, it makes sense to disable udev completely and create static
   devices. Servers are one example of this situation. Does a server need the
   capability of handling dynamic devices? Only the system administrator can
   answer that question, but in many cases the answer will be no.

   If dynamic devices are not desired, then static devices must be created on
   the system. In the default configuration, the /etc/rc.d/rcS.d/S10udev boot
   script mounts a tmpfs partition over the /dev directory. This problem can
   be overcome by mounting the root partition temporarily:

  Warning

   If the instructions below are not followed carefully, your system could
   become unbootable.

 mount --bind / /mnt
 cp -a /dev/* /mnt/dev
 rm /etc/rc.d/rcS.d/{S10udev,S50udev_retry}
 umount /mnt

   At this point, the system will use static devices upon the next reboot.
   Create any desired additional devices using mknod.

   If you want to restore the dynamic devices, recreate the
   /etc/rc.d/rcS.d/{S10udev,S50udev_retry} symbolic links and reboot again.
   Static devices do not need to be removed (console and null are always
   needed) because they are covered by the tmpfs partition. Disk usage for
   devices is negligible (about 20â30 bytes per entry.)

  Devices for DVD Drives

   If the initial boot process does not set up the /dev/dvd device properly,
   it can be installed using the following modification to the default udev
   rules. As the root user, run:

 sed '1d;/SYMLINK.*cdrom/ a\
 KERNEL=="sr0", ENV{ID_CDROM_DVD}=="1", SYMLINK+="dvd", OPTIONS+="link_priority=-100"' \
 /lib/udev/rules.d/60-cdrom_id.rules > /etc/udev/rules.d/60-cdrom_id.rules

Configuring for Adding Users

   Together, the /usr/sbin/useradd command and /etc/skel directory (both are
   easy to set up and use) provide a way to assure new users are added to
   your LFS system with the same beginning settings for things such as the
   PATH, keyboard processing and other environmental variables. Using these
   two facilities makes it easier to assure this initial state for each new
   user added to the system.

   The /etc/skel directory holds copies of various initialization and other
   files that may be copied to the new user's home directory when the
   /usr/sbin/useradd program adds the new user.

        Useradd

   The useradd program uses a collection of default values kept in
   /etc/default/useradd. This file is created in a base LFS installation by
   the Shadow package. If it has been removed or renamed, the useradd program
   uses some internal defaults. You can see the default values by running
   /usr/sbin/useradd -D.

   To change these values, simply modify the /etc/default/useradd file as the
   root user. An alternative to directly modifying the file is to run useradd
   as the root user while supplying the desired modifications on the command
   line. Information on how to do this can be found in the useradd man page.

        /etc/skel

   To get started, create an /etc/skel directory and make sure it is writable
   only by the system administrator, usually root. Creating the directory as
   root is the best way to go.

   The mode of any files from this part of the book that you put in /etc/skel
   should be writable only by the owner. Also, since there is no telling what
   kind of sensitive information a user may eventually place in their copy of
   these files, you should make them unreadable by "group" and "other".

   You can also put other files in /etc/skel and different permissions may be
   needed for them.

   Decide which initialization files should be provided in every (or most)
   new user's home directory. The decisions you make will affect what you do
   in the next two sections, The Bash Shell Startup Files and The vimrc
   Files. Some or all of those files will be useful for root, any
   already-existing users, and new users.

   The files from those sections that you might want to place in /etc/skel
   include .inputrc, .bash_profile, .bashrc, .bash_logout, .dircolors, and
   .vimrc. If you are unsure which of these should be placed there, just
   continue to the following sections, read each section and any references
   provided, and then make your decision.

   You will run a slightly modified set of commands for files which are
   placed in /etc/skel. Each section will remind you of this. In brief, the
   book's commands have been written for files not added to /etc/skel and
   instead just sends the results to the user's home directory. If the file
   is going to be in /etc/skel, change the book's command(s) to send output
   there instead and then just copy the file from /etc/skel to the
   appropriate directories, like /etc, ~ or the home directory of any other
   user already in the system.

        When Adding a User

   When adding a new user with useradd, use the -m parameter, which tells
   useradd to create the user's home directory and copy files from /etc/skel
   (can be overridden) to the new user's home directory. For example (perform
   as the root user):

 useradd -m <newuser>

About System Users and Groups

   Throughout BLFS, many packages install programs that run as daemons or in
   some way should have a user or group name assigned. Generally these names
   are used to map a user ID (uid) or group ID (gid) for system use.
   Generally the specific uid or gid numbers used by these applications are
   not significant. The exception of course, is that root has a uid and gid
   of 0 (zero) that is indeed special. The uid values are stored in
   /etc/passwd and the gid values are found in /etc/group.

   Customarily, Unix systems classify users and groups into two categories:
   system users and regular users. The system users and groups are given low
   numbers and regular users and groups have numeric values greater than all
   the system values. The cutoff for these numbers is found in two parameters
   in the /etc/login.defs configuration file. The default UID_MIN value is
   1000 and the default GID_MIN value is 1000. If a specific uid or gid value
   is not specified when creating a user with useradd or a group with
   groupadd the values assigned will always be above these cutoff values.

   Additionally, the Linux Standard Base recommends that system uid and gid
   values should be below 100.

   Below is a table of suggested uid/gid values used in BLFS beyond those
   defined in a base LFS installation. These can be changed as desired, but
   provide a suggested set of consistent values.

   Table 3.1. UID/GID Suggested Values

The Bash Shell Startup Files

   The shell program /bin/bash (hereafter referred to as just "the shell")
   uses a collection of startup files to help create an environment. Each
   file has a specific use and may affect login and interactive environments
   differently. The files in the /etc directory generally provide global
   settings. If an equivalent file exists in your home directory it may
   override the global settings.

   An interactive login shell is started after a successful login, using
   /bin/login, by reading the /etc/passwd file. This shell invocation
   normally reads /etc/profile and its private equivalent ~/.bash_profile (or
   ~/.profile if called as /bin/sh) upon startup.

   An interactive non-login shell is normally started at the command-line
   using a shell program (e.g., [prompt]$/bin/bash) or by the /bin/su
   command. An interactive non-login shell is also started with a terminal
   program such as xterm or konsole from within a graphical environment. This
   type of shell invocation normally copies the parent environment and then
   reads the user's ~/.bashrc file for additional startup configuration
   instructions.

   A non-interactive shell is usually present when a shell script is running.
   It is non-interactive because it is processing a script and not waiting
   for user input between commands. For these shell invocations, only the
   environment inherited from the parent shell is used.

   The file ~/.bash_logout is not used for an invocation of the shell. It is
   read and executed when a user exits from an interactive login shell.

   Many distributions use /etc/bashrc for system wide initialization of
   non-login shells. This file is usually called from the user's ~/.bashrc
   file and is not built directly into bash itself. This convention is
   followed in this section.

   For more information see info bash -- Nodes: Bash Startup Files and
   Interactive Shells.

  Note

   Most of the instructions below are used to create files located in the
   /etc directory structure which requires you to execute the commands as the
   root user. If you elect to create the files in user's home directories
   instead, you should run the commands as an unprivileged user.

   User Notes:
   http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/bash-shell-startup-files

  /etc/profile

   Here is a base /etc/profile. This file starts by setting up some helper
   functions and some basic parameters. It specifies some bash history
   parameters and, for security purposes, disables keeping a permanent
   history file for the root user. It also sets a default user prompt. It
   then calls small, single purpose scripts in the /etc/profile.d directory
   to provide most of the initialization.

   For more information on the escape sequences you can use for your prompt
   (i.e., the PS1 environment variable) see info bash -- Node: Printing a
   Prompt.

    The /etc/profile.d Directory

   Now create the /etc/profile.d directory, where the individual
   initialization scripts are placed:

 install --directory --mode=0755 --owner=root --group=root /etc/profile.d

    /etc/profile.d/bash_completion.sh

  Note

   Using the bash completion script below is controversial. Not all users
   like it. It adds many (usually over 1000) lines to the bash environment
   and makes it difficult to use the 'set' command to examine simple
   environment variables. Omitting this script does not interfere with the
   ability of bash to use the tab key for file name completion.

   This script imports bash completion scripts, installed by many other BLFS
   packages, to allow TAB command line completion.

 cat > /etc/profile.d/bash_completion.sh << "EOF"
 # Begin /etc/profile.d/bash_completion.sh

   Make sure that the directory exists:

 install --directory --mode=0755 --owner=root --group=root /etc/bash_completion.d

    /etc/profile.d/dircolors.sh

   This script uses the ~/.dircolors and /etc/dircolors files to control the
   colors of file names in a directory listing. They control colorized output
   of things like ls --color. The explanation of how to initialize these
   files is at the end of this section.

 cat > /etc/profile.d/dircolors.sh << "EOF"
 # Setup for /bin/ls and /bin/grep to support color, the alias is in /etc/bashrc.
 if [ -f "/etc/dircolors" ] ; then
         eval $(dircolors -b /etc/dircolors)
 fi

 if [ -f "$HOME/.dircolors" ] ; then
         eval $(dircolors -b $HOME/.dircolors)
 fi

 alias ls='ls --color=auto'
 alias grep='grep --color=auto'
 EOF

    /etc/profile.d/extrapaths.sh

   This script adds some useful paths to the PATH and can be used to
   customize other PATH related environment variables (e.g. LD_LIBRARY_PATH,
   etc) that may be needed for all users.

 cat > /etc/profile.d/extrapaths.sh << "EOF"
 if [ -d /usr/local/lib/pkgconfig ] ; then
         pathappend /usr/local/lib/pkgconfig PKG_CONFIG_PATH

 fi

 # Set some defaults before other applications add to these paths.
 pathappend /usr/share/man  MANPATH
 pathappend /usr/share/info INFOPATH
 EOF

    /etc/profile.d/readline.sh

   This script sets up the default inputrc configuration file. If the user
   does not have individual settings, it uses the global file.

 cat > /etc/profile.d/readline.sh << "EOF"
 # Setup the INPUTRC environment variable.
 if [ -z "$INPUTRC" -a ! -f "$HOME/.inputrc" ] ; then
         INPUTRC=/etc/inputrc
 fi
 export INPUTRC
 EOF

    /etc/profile.d/umask.sh

   Setting the umask value is important for security. Here the default group
   write permissions are turned off for system users and when the user name
   and group name are not the same.

 cat > /etc/profile.d/umask.sh << "EOF"
 # By default, the umask should be set.
 if [ "$(id -gn)" = "$(id -un)" -a $EUID -gt 99 ] ; then
   umask 002
 else
   umask 022
 fi
 EOF

    /etc/profile.d/i18n.sh

   This script sets an environment variable necessary for native language
   support. A full discussion on determining this variable can be found on
   the LFS Bash Shell Startup Files page.

 cat > /etc/profile.d/i18n.sh << "EOF"
 # Set up i18n variables
 export LANG=<ll>_<CC>.<charmap><@modifiers>
 EOF

    Other Initialization Values

   Other initialization can easily be added to the profile by adding
   additional scripts to the /etc/profile.d directory.

  /etc/bashrc

   Here is a base /etc/bashrc. Comments in the file should explain everything
   you need.

 else
   PS1="$GREEN\u [ $NORMAL\w$GREEN ]\$ $NORMAL"
 fi

 unset RED GREEN NORMAL

 # End /etc/bashrc
 EOF

  ~/.bash_profile

   Here is a base ~/.bash_profile. If you want each new user to have this
   file automatically, just change the output of the command to
   /etc/skel/.bash_profile and check the permissions after the command is
   run. You can then copy /etc/skel/.bash_profile to the home directories of
   already existing users, including root, and set the owner and group
   appropriately.

 cat > ~/.bash_profile << "EOF"
 # Begin ~/.bash_profile
 # Written for Beyond Linux From Scratch

 # updated by Bruce Dubbs <bdubbs@linuxfromscratch.org>

 # Personal environment variables and startup programs.

 # Personal aliases and functions should go in ~/.bashrc.  System wide

 if [ -f "$HOME/.bashrc" ] ; then
   source $HOME/.bashrc
 fi

 if [ -d "$HOME/bin" ] ; then
   pathprepend $HOME/bin
 fi

 # Having . in the PATH is dangerous
 #if [ $EUID -gt 99 ]; then
 #  pathappend .
 #fi

 # End ~/.bash_profile
 EOF

  ~/.profile

   Here is a base ~/.profile. The comments and instructions for using
   /etc/skel for .bash_profile above also apply here. Only the target file
   names are different.

 cat > ~/.profile << "EOF"
 # Begin ~/.profile
 # Personal environment variables and startup programs.

 if [ -d "$HOME/bin" ] ; then
   pathprepend $HOME/bin
 fi

 # Set up user specific i18n variables
 #export LANG=<ll>_<CC>.<charmap><@modifiers>

 # End ~/.profile
 EOF

  ~/.bashrc

   Here is a base ~/.bashrc.

 cat > ~/.bashrc << "EOF"
 # Begin ~/.bashrc
 # Written for Beyond Linux From Scratch
 # by James Robertson <jameswrobertson@earthlink.net>

 # Personal aliases and functions.

 # Personal environment variables and startup programs should go in

 if [ -f "/etc/bashrc" ] ; then
   source /etc/bashrc
 fi

 # Set up user specific i18n variables
 #export LANG=<ll>_<CC>.<charmap><@modifiers>

 # End ~/.bashrc
 EOF

  ~/.bash_logout

   This is an empty ~/.bash_logout that can be used as a template. You will
   notice that the base ~/.bash_logout does not include a clear command. This
   is because the clear is handled in the /etc/issue file.

 cat > ~/.bash_logout << "EOF"
 # Begin ~/.bash_logout
 # Written for Beyond Linux From Scratch
 # by James Robertson <jameswrobertson@earthlink.net>

 # Personal items to perform on logout.

 # End ~/.bash_logout
 EOF

  /etc/dircolors

   If you want to use the dircolors capability, then run the following
   command. The /etc/skel setup steps shown above also can be used here to
   provide a ~/.dircolors file when a new user is set up. As before, just
   change the output file name on the following command and assure the
   permissions, owner, and group are correct on the files created and/or
   copied.

 dircolors -p > /etc/dircolors

   If you wish to customize the colors used for different file types, you can
   edit the /etc/dircolors file. The instructions for setting the colors are
   embedded in the file.

The /etc/vimrc and ~/.vimrc Files

   The LFS book installs Vim as its text editor. At this point it should be
   noted that there are a lot of different editing applications out there
   including Emacs, nano, Joe and many more. Anyone who has been around the
   Internet (especially usenet) for a short time will certainly have observed
   at least one flame war, usually involving Vim and Emacs users!

   The LFS book creates a basic vimrc file. In this section you'll find an
   attempt to enhance this file. At startup, vim reads the global
   configuration file (/etc/vimrc) as well as a user-specific file
   (~/.vimrc). Either or both can be tailored to suit the needs of your
   particular system.

   Here is a slightly expanded .vimrc that you can put in ~/.vimrc to provide
   user specific effects. Of course, if you put it into /etc/skel/.vimrc
   instead, it will be made available to users you add to the system later.
   You can also copy the file from /etc/skel/.vimrc to the home directory of
   users already on the system, such as root. Be sure to set permissions,
   owner, and group if you do copy anything directly from /etc/skel.

 " Begin .vimrc

 set columns=80
 set wrapmargin=8
 set ruler

 " End .vimrc

   Note that the comment tags are " instead of the more usual # or //. This
   is correct, the syntax for vimrc is slightly unusual.

   Below you'll find a quick explanation of what each of the options in this
   example file means here:

     * set columns=80: This simply sets the number of columns used on the
       screen.

     * set wrapmargin=8: This is the number of characters from the right
       window border where wrapping starts.

     * set ruler: This makes vim show the current row and column at the
       bottom right of the screen.

   More information on the many vim options can be found by reading the help

Customizing your Logon with /etc/issue

   When you first boot up your new LFS system, the logon screen will be nice
   and plain (as it should be in a bare-bones system). Many people however,
   will want their system to display some information in the logon message.
   This can be accomplished using the file /etc/issue.

   The /etc/issue file is a plain text file which will also accept certain
   escape sequences (see below) in order to insert information about the
   system. There is also the file issue.net which can be used when logging on
   remotely. ssh however, will only use it if you set the option in the
   configuration file and will not interpret the escape sequences shown
   below.

   One of the most common things which people want to do is clear the screen
   at each logon. The easiest way of doing that is to put a "clear" escape
   sequence into /etc/issue. A simple way of doing this is to issue the
   command clear > /etc/issue. This will insert the relevant escape code into
   the start of the /etc/issue file. Note that if you do this, when you edit
   the file, you should leave the characters (normally '^[[H^[[2J') on the
   first line alone.

  Note

   Terminal escape sequences are special codes recognized by the terminal.
   The ^[ represents an ASCII ESC character. The sequence ESC [ H puts the
   cursor in the upper left hand corner of the screen and ESC 2 J erases the
   screen. For more information on terminal escape sequences see
   http://rtfm.etla.org/xterm/ctlseq.html

   The following sequences are recognized by agetty (the program which
   usually parses /etc/issue). This information is from man agetty where you
   can find extra information about the logon process.

   The issue file can contain certain character sequences to display various
   information. All issue sequences consist of a backslash (\) immediately
   followed by one of the letters explained below (so \d in /etc/issue would
   insert the current date).

 b   Insert the baudrate of the current line.
 d   Insert the current date.
 s   Insert the system name, the name of the operating system.
 l   Insert the name of the current tty line.
 m   Insert the architecture identifier of the machine, e.g., i686.
 n   Insert the nodename of the machine, also known as the hostname.
 o   Insert the domainname of the machine.
 r   Insert the release number of the kernel, e.g., 2.6.11.12.
 t   Insert the current time.
 u   Insert the number of current users logged in.
 U   Insert the string "1 user" or "<n> users" where <n> is the
     number of current users logged in.
 v   Insert the version of the OS, e.g., the build-date etc.

Random Number Generation

   The Linux kernel supplies a random number generator which is accessed
   through /dev/random and /dev/urandom. Programs that utilize the random and
   urandom devices, such as OpenSSH, will benefit from these instructions.

   When a Linux system starts up without much operator interaction, the
   entropy pool (data used to compute a random number) may be in a fairly
   predictable state. This creates the real possibility that the number
   generated at startup may always be the same. In order to counteract this
   effect, you should carry the entropy pool information across your
   shut-downs and start-ups.

   Install the /etc/rc.d/init.d/random init script included with the
   blfs-bootscripts-20190609 package.

Chapter 4. Security

   Security takes many forms in a computing environment. After some initial
   discussion, this chapter gives examples of three different types of
   security: access, prevention and detection.

   Access for users is usually handled by login or an application designed to
   handle the login function. In this chapter, we show how to enhance login
   by setting policies with PAM modules. Access via networks can also be
   secured by policies set by iptables, commonly referred to as a firewall.
   The Network Security Services (NSS) and Netscape Portable Runtime (NSPR)
   libraries can be installed and shared among the many applications
   requiring them. For applications that don't offer the best security, you
   can use the Stunnel package to wrap an application daemon inside an SSL
   tunnel.

   Prevention of breaches, like a trojan, are assisted by applications like
   GnuPG, specifically the ability to confirm signed packages, which
   recognizes modifications of the tarball after the packager creates it.

   Finally, we touch on detection with a package that stores "signatures" of
   critical files (defined by the administrator) and then regenerates those
   "signatures" and compares for files that have been changed.

Vulnerabilities

  About vulnerabilities

   All software has bugs. Sometimes, a bug can be exploited, for example to
   allow users to gain enhanced privileges (perhaps gaining a root shell, or
   simply accessing or deleting other user's files), or to allow a remote
   site to crash an application (denial of service), or for theft of data.
   These bugs are labelled as vulnerabilities.

   The main place where vulnerabilities get logged is cve.mitre.org.
   Unfortunately, many vulnerability numbers (CVE-yyyy-nnnn) are initially
   only labelled as "reserved" when distributions start issuing fixes. Also,
   some vulnerabilities apply to particular combinations of configure
   options, or only apply to old versions of packages which have long since
   been updated in BLFS.

   BLFS differs from distributions - there is no BLFS security team, and the
   editors only become aware of vulnerabilities after they are public
   knowledge. Sometimes, a package with a vulnerability will not be updated
   in the book for a long time. Issues can be logged in the Trac system,
   which might speed up resolution.

   The normal way for BLFS to fix a vulnerability is, ideally, to update the
   book to a new fixed release of the package. Sometimes that happens even
   before the vulnerability is public knowledge, so there is no guarantee
   that it will be shown as a vulnerability fix in the Changelog.
   Alternatively, a sed command, or a patch taken from a distribution, may be
   appropriate.

   The bottom line is that you are responsible for your own security, and for
   assessing the potential impact of any problems.

   To keep track of what is being discovered, you may wish to follow the
   security announcements of one or more distributions. For example, Debian
   has Debian security. Fedora's links on security are at the Fedora wiki.
   Details of Gentoo linux security announcements are discussed at Gentoo
   security. Finally, the Slackware archives of security announcements are at
   Slackware security.

   The most general English source is perhaps the Full Disclosure Mailing
   List, but please read the comment on that page. If you use other languages
   you may prefer other sites such as http://www.heise.de/security heise.de
   (German) or cert.hr (Croatian). These are not linux-specific. There is
   also a daily update at lwn.net for subscribers (free access to the data
   after 2 weeks, but their vulnerabilities database at
   lwn.net/Vulnerabilities is unrestricted).

   For some packages, subscribing to their 'announce' lists will provide
   prompt news of newer versions.

make-ca-1.4

  Introduction to make-ca

   Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) is a method to validate the authenticity
   of an otherwise unknown entity across untrusted networks. PKI works by
   establishing a chain of trust, rather than trusting each individual host
   or entity explicitly. In order for a certificate presented by a remote
   entity to be trusted, that certificate must present a complete chain of
   certificates that can be validated using the root certificate of a
   Certificate Authority (CA) that is trusted by the local machine.

   Establishing trust with a CA involves validating things like company
   address, ownership, contact information, etc., and ensuring that the CA
   has followed best practices, such as undergoing periodic security audits
   by independent investigators and maintaining an always available
   certificate revocation list. This is well outside the scope of BLFS (as it
   is for most Linux distributions). The certificate store provided here is
   taken from the Mozilla Foundation, who have established very strict
   inclusion policies described here.

   This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS-9.0
   platform.

    make-ca Dependencies

      Required

   p11-kit-0.23.16.1 (required at runtime to generate certificate stores from
   trust anchors)

      Optional (runtime)

   Java-12.0.2 or OpenJDK-12.0.2 (to generate a java PKCS#12 store), and
   NSS-3.45 (to generate a shared NSSDB)

   User Notes: http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/make-ca

  Installation of make-ca

   The make-ca script will download and process the certificates included in
   the certdata.txt file for use as trust anchors for the p11-kit-0.23.16.1
   trust module. Additionally, it will generate system certificate stores
   used by BLFS applications (if the recommended and optional applications
   are present on the system). Any local certificates stored in
   /etc/ssl/local will be imported to both the trust anchors and the
   generated certificate stores (overriding Mozilla's trust). Additionally,
   any modified trust values will be copied from the trust anchors to
   /etc/ssl/local prior to any updates, preserving custom trust values that
   differ from Mozilla when using the trust utility from p11-kit to operate
   on the trust store.

   To install the various certificate stores, first install the make-ca
   script into the correct location. As the root user:

 make install &&
 install -vdm755 /etc/ssl/local

   As the root user, after installing p11-kit-0.23.16.1, download the
   certificate source and prepare for system use with the following command:

  Note

   If running the script a second time with the same version of certdata.txt,
   for instance, to add additional stores as the requisite software is
   installed, add the -r switch to the command line. If packaging, run
   make-ca --help to see all available command line options.

 /usr/sbin/make-ca -g

   Previous versions of BLFS used the path /etc/ssl/ca-bundle.crt for the
   GnuTLS-3.6.9 certificate store. If software is still installed that
   references this file, create a compatibility symlink for the old location
   as the root user:

 ln -sfv /etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt /etc/ssl/ca-bundle.crt

   You should periodically update the store with the above command, either
   manually, or via a cron job. If you've installed Fcron-3.2.1 and completed
   the section on periodic jobs, execute the following commands, as the root
   user, to create a weekly cron job:

 install -vdm755 /etc/cron.weekly                       &&
 cat > /etc/cron.weekly/update-pki.sh << "EOF" &&
 #!/bin/bash
 /usr/sbin/make-ca -g
 EOF
 chmod 754 /etc/cron.weekly/update-pki.sh

  Configuring make-ca

   For most users, no additional configuration is necessary, however, the
   default certdata.txt file provided by make-ca is obtained from the
   mozilla-release branch, and is modified to provide a Mercurial revision.
   This will be the correct version for most systems. There are several other
   variants of the file available for use that might be preferred for one
   reason or another, including the files shipped with Mozilla products in
   this book. RedHat and OpenSUSE, for instance, use the version included in
   NSS-3.45. Additional upstream downloads are available at the links
   included in /etc/make-ca.conf.dist. Simply copy the file to
   /etc/make-ca.conf and edit as appropriate.

    About Trust Arguments

   There are three trust types that are recognized by the make-ca script,
   SSL/TLS, S/Mime, and code signing. For OpenSSL, these are serverAuth,
   emailProtection, and codeSigning respectively. If one of the three trust
   arguments is omitted, the certificate is neither trusted, nor rejected for
   that role. Clients that use OpenSSL or NSS encountering this certificate
   will present a warning to the user. Clients using GnuTLS without p11-kit
   support are not aware of trusted certificates. To include this CA into the
   ca-bundle.crt, email-ca-bundle.crt, or objsign-ca-bundle.crt files (the
   GnuTLS legacy bundles), it must have the appropriate trust arguments.

    Adding Additional CA Certificates

   The /etc/ssl/local directory is available to add additional CA
   certificates to the system. For instance, you might need to add an
   organization or government CA certificate. Files in this directory must be
   in the OpenSSL trusted certificate format. To create an OpenSSL trusted
   certificate from a regular PEM encoded file, you need to add trust
   arguments to the openssl command, and create a new certificate. For
   example, using the CAcert roots, if you want to trust both for all three
   roles, the following commands will create appropriate OpenSSL trusted
   certificates (run as the root user after Wget-1.20.3 is installed):

 wget http://www.cacert.org/certs/root.crt &&
 wget http://www.cacert.org/certs/class3.crt &&
 openssl x509 -in root.crt -text -fingerprint -setalias "CAcert Class 1 root" \
         -addtrust serverAuth -addtrust emailProtection -addtrust codeSigning \
         > /etc/ssl/local/CAcert_Class_1_root.pem &&
 openssl x509 -in class3.crt -text -fingerprint -setalias "CAcert Class 3 root" \
         -addtrust serverAuth -addtrust emailProtection -addtrust codeSigning \
         > /etc/ssl/local/CAcert_Class_3_root.pem &&
 /usr/sbin/make-ca -r -f

    Overriding Mozilla Trust

   Occasionally, there may be instances where you don't agree with Mozilla's
   inclusion of a particular certificate authority. If you'd like to override
   the default trust of a particular CA, simply create a copy of the existing
   certificate in /etc/ssl/local with different trust arguments. For example,
   if you'd like to distrust the "Makebelieve_CA_Root" file, run the
   following commands:

 openssl x509 -in /etc/ssl/certs/Makebelieve_CA_Root.pem \
              -text \
              -fingerprint \
              -setalias "Disabled Makebelieve CA Root" \
              -addreject serverAuth \
              -addreject emailProtection \
              -addreject codeSigning \
        > /etc/ssl/local/Disabled_Makebelieve_CA_Root.pem &&
 /usr/sbin/make-ca -r -f

CrackLib-2.9.7

  Introduction to CrackLib

   The CrackLib package contains a library used to enforce strong passwords
   by comparing user selected passwords to words in chosen word lists.

   This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS-9.0
   platform.

    Package Information

     * Download (HTTP):
       https://github.com/cracklib/cracklib/releases/download/v2.9.7/cracklib-2.9.7.tar.bz2

     * Download MD5 sum: 0d68de25332cee5660850528a385427f

     * Download size: 592 KB

     * Estimated disk space required: 4.2 MB

     * Estimated build time: less than 0.1 SBU

    Additional Downloads

     * Recommended word list for English-speaking countries (size: 6.7 MB;
       md5sum: 94e9963e4786294f7fb0f2efd7618551):
       https://github.com/cracklib/cracklib/releases/download/v2.9.7/cracklib-words-2.9.7.bz2

   There are additional word lists available for download, e.g., from
   http://www.cotse.com/tools/wordlists.htm. CrackLib can utilize as many, or
   as few word lists you choose to install.

  Important

   Users tend to base their passwords on regular words of the spoken
   language, and crackers know that. CrackLib is intended to filter out such
   bad passwords at the source using a dictionary created from word lists. To
   accomplish this, the word list(s) for use with CrackLib must be an
   exhaustive list of words and word-based keystroke combinations likely to
   be chosen by users of the system as (guessable) passwords.

   The default word list recommended above for downloading mostly satisfies
   this role in English-speaking countries. In other situations, it may be
   necessary to download (or even create) additional word lists.

   Note that word lists suitable for spell-checking are not usable as
   CrackLib word lists in countries with non-Latin based alphabets, because
   of âword-based keystroke combinationsâ that make bad passwords.

    CrackLib Dependencies

      Optional

   Python-2.7.16

   User Notes: http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/cracklib

  Installation of CrackLib

   Install CrackLib by running the following commands:

 sed -i '/skipping/d' util/packer.c &&

 ./configure --prefix=/usr    \
             --disable-static \
             --with-default-dict=/lib/cracklib/pw_dict &&
 make

   Now, as the root user:

 make install                      &&
 mv -v /usr/lib/libcrack.so.* /lib &&
 ln -sfv ../../lib/$(readlink /usr/lib/libcrack.so) /usr/lib/libcrack.so

   Issue the following commands as the root user to install the recommended
   word list and create the CrackLib dictionary. Other word lists (text
   based, one word per line) can also be used by simply installing them into
   /usr/share/dict and adding them to the create-cracklib-dict command.

 install -v -m644 -D    ../cracklib-words-2.9.7.bz2 \
                          /usr/share/dict/cracklib-words.bz2    &&

 bunzip2 -v               /usr/share/dict/cracklib-words.bz2    &&
 ln -v -sf cracklib-words /usr/share/dict/words                 &&
 echo $(hostname) >>      /usr/share/dict/cracklib-extra-words  &&
 install -v -m755 -d      /lib/cracklib                         &&

 create-cracklib-dict     /usr/share/dict/cracklib-words \
                          /usr/share/dict/cracklib-extra-words

   If desired, check the proper operation of the library as an unprivileged
   user by issuing the following command:

 make test

  Important

   If you are installing CrackLib after your LFS system has been completed
   and you have the Shadow package installed, you must reinstall Shadow-4.7
   if you wish to provide strong password support on your system. If you are
   now going to install the Linux-PAM-1.3.1 package, you may disregard this
   note as Shadow will be reinstalled after the Linux-PAM installation.

  Command Explanations

   sed -i '/skipping/d' util/packer.c: Remove a meaningless warning.

   --with-default-dict=/lib/cracklib/pw_dict: This parameter forces the
   installation of the CrackLib dictionary to the /lib hierarchy.

   --disable-static: This switch prevents installation of static versions of
   the libraries.

   mv -v /usr/lib/libcrack.so.2* /lib and ln -v -sf
   ../../lib/libcrack.so.2.9.0 ...: These two commands move the
   libcrack.so.2.9.0 library and associated symlink from /usr/lib to /lib,
   then recreates the /usr/lib/libcrack.so symlink pointing to the relocated
   file.

   install -v -m644 -D ...: This command creates the /usr/share/dict
   directory (if it doesn't already exist) and installs the compressed word
   list there.

   ln -v -s cracklib-words /usr/share/dict/words: The word list is linked to
   /usr/share/dict/words as historically, words is the primary word list in
   the /usr/share/dict directory. Omit this command if you already have a
   /usr/share/dict/words file installed on your system.

   echo $(hostname) >>...: The value of hostname is echoed to a file called
   cracklib-extra-words. This extra file is intended to be a site specific
   list which includes easy to guess passwords such as company or department
   names, user names, product names, computer names, domain names, etc.

   create-cracklib-dict ...: This command creates the CrackLib dictionary
   from the word lists. Modify the command to add any additional word lists
   you have installed.

  Contents

   Installed Programs: cracklib-check, cracklib-format, cracklib-packer,
   cracklib-unpacker and create-cracklib-dict
   Installed Libraries: libcrack.so and the _cracklibmodule.so Python module
   Installed Directories: /lib/cracklib, /usr/share/dict and
   /usr/share/cracklib

    Short Descriptions

   cracklib-check       is used to determine if a password is strong.         
   cracklib-format      is used to format text files (lowercases all words,   
                        removes control characters and sorts the lists).      
   cracklib-packer      creates a database with words read from standard      
                        input.                                                
   cracklib-unpacker    displays on standard output the database specified.   
   create-cracklib-dict is used to create the CrackLib dictionary from the    
                        given word list(s).                                   
   libcrack.so          provides a fast dictionary lookup method for strong   
                        password enforcement.

  Installation of cryptsetup

   Install cryptsetup by running the following commands:

 ./configure --prefix=/usr \
             --with-crypto_backend=openssl &&
 make

   To test the result, issue as the root user: make check. Some tests may
   fail if the kernel configuration parameters above are not set. One (of 12)
   tests is known to fail.

   Now, as the root user:

 make install

  Command Explanations

   --with-crypto_backend=openssl: This parameter selects the cryptographic
   libraries to use with the application. gcrypt is the default.

  Configuring cryptsetup

   Because of the number of possible configurations, setup of encrypted
   volumes is beyond the scope of the BLFS book. Please see the configuration
   guide in the cryptsetup FAQ.

Cyrus SASL-2.1.27

  Introduction to Cyrus SASL

   The Cyrus SASL package contains a Simple Authentication and Security
   Layer, a method for adding authentication support to connection-based
   protocols. To use SASL, a protocol includes a command for identifying and
   authenticating a user to a server and for optionally negotiating
   protection of subsequent protocol interactions. If its use is negotiated,
   a security layer is inserted between the protocol and the connection.

   This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS-9.0
   platform.

  Installation of Cyrus SASL

  Note

   This package does not support parallel build.

   Install Cyrus SASL by running the following commands:

 ./configure --prefix=/usr        \
             --sysconfdir=/etc    \
             --enable-auth-sasldb \

   DB.

   --with-ldap: This switch enables the OpenLDAP support.

   --enable-ldapdb: This switch enables the LDAPDB authentication backend.
   There is a circular dependency with this parameter. See
   http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/cyrus-sasl for a solution to
   this problem.

   --enable-java: This switch enables compiling of the Java support
   libraries.

   --enable-login: This option enables unsupported LOGIN authentication.

   --enable-ntlm: This option enables unsupported NTLM authentication.

   install -v -m644 ...: These commands install documentation which is not
   installed by the make install command.

   install -v -m700 -d /var/lib/sasl: This directory must exist when starting
   saslauthd or using the sasldb plugin. If you're not going to be running
   the daemon or using the plugins, you may omit the creation of this
   directory.

   User Notes: http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/gnupg2

  Installation of GnuPG

   By default GnuPG doesn't install the deprecated gpg-zip script. But it is
   still needed by some programs. Make GnuPG install it with:

 sed -e '/noinst_SCRIPTS = gpg-zip/c sbin_SCRIPTS += gpg-zip' \
     -i tools/Makefile.in

   Install GnuPG by running the following commands:

 ./configure --prefix=/usr            \
             --enable-symcryptrun     \
             --localstatedir=/var     \
             --docdir=/usr/share/doc/gnupg-2.2.17 &&
 make &&

 makeinfo --html --no-split -o doc/gnupg_nochunks.html doc/gnupg.texi &&
 makeinfo --plaintext       -o doc/gnupg.txt           doc/gnupg.texi &&
 make -C doc html

   If you have texlive-20190410 installed and you wish to create
   documentation in alternate formats, issue the following commands (fig2dev
   is needed for the ps format):

 make -C doc pdf ps

   To test the results, issue: make check.

   Note that if you have already installed GnuPG, the instructions below will
   overwrite /usr/share/man/man1/gpg-zip.1. Now, as the root user:

 make install &&

 install -v -m755 -d /usr/share/doc/gnupg-2.2.17/html            &&
 install -v -m644    doc/gnupg_nochunks.html \
                     /usr/share/doc/gnupg-2.2.17/html/gnupg.html &&
 install -v -m644    doc/*.texi doc/gnupg.txt \
                     /usr/share/doc/gnupg-2.2.17 &&
 install -v -m644    doc/gnupg.html/* \
                     /usr/share/doc/gnupg-2.2.17/html

   If you created alternate formats of the documentation, install them using
   the following command as the root user:

 install -v -m644 doc/gnupg.{pdf,dvi,ps} \
                  /usr/share/doc/gnupg-2.2.17

  Command Explanations

   sed ... tools/Makefile.in: This command is needed to build the gpg-zip
   program.

   --docdir=/usr/share/doc/gnupg-2.2.17: This switch changes the default
   docdir to /usr/share/doc/gnupg-2.2.17.

   --enable-symcryptrun: This switch enables building the symcryptrun
   program.

   --enable-all-tests: allows more tests to be run with make check.

   --enable-g13: This switch enables building the g13 program.

GnuTLS-3.6.9

  Introduction to GnuTLS

   The GnuTLS package contains libraries and userspace tools which provide a
   secure layer over a reliable transport layer. Currently the GnuTLS library
   implements the proposed standards by the IETF's TLS working group. Quoting
   from the TLS protocol specification:

   âThe TLS protocol provides communications privacy over the Internet. The
   protocol allows client/server applications to communicate in a way that is
   designed to prevent eavesdropping, tampering, or message forgery.â

   GnuTLS provides support for TLS 1.3, TLS 1.2, TLS 1.1, TLS 1.0, and SSL
   3.0 protocols, TLS extensions, including server name and max record size.
   Additionally, the library supports authentication using the SRP protocol,
   X.509 certificates and OpenPGP keys, along with support for the TLS
   Pre-Shared-Keys (PSK) extension, the Inner Application (TLS/IA) extension
   and X.509 and OpenPGP certificate handling.

   This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS-9.0
   platform.

       tests)

    GnuTLS Dependencies

      Required

   Nettle-3.5.1

      Recommended

   make-ca-1.4, libunistring-0.9.10, libtasn1-4.14, and p11-kit-0.23.16.1

      Optional

   Doxygen-1.8.16, GTK-Doc-1.32, Guile-2.2.6, libidn-1.35 or libidn2-2.2.0
   Net-tools-CVS_20101030 (used during the test suite), texlive-20190410 or
   install-tl-unx, Unbound-1.9.2 (to build the DANE library), Valgrind-3.15.0
   (used during the test suite), autogen, cmocka and datefudge (used during
   the test suite if the DANE library is built), and Trousers (Trusted
   Platform Module support)

  Note

   Note that if you do not install libtasn1-4.14, an older version shipped in
   the GnuTLS tarball will be used instead.

   User Notes: http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/gnutls

  Installation of GnuTLS

   Install GnuTLS by running the following commands:

 ./configure --prefix=/usr \
             --docdir=/usr/share/doc/gnutls-3.6.9 \
             --disable-guile \
             --with-default-trust-store-pkcs11="pkcs11:" &&
 make

   To test the results, issue: make check. If a prior version of GnuTLS (or
   the same version but without all of the recommended dependencies) has been
   installed, some tests may fail. If /usr/lib/libgnutls.so and the target of
   that symlink are moved or renamed so that they cannot be found, all tests
   should pass and the install procedure will restore libgnutls.so and the
   versioned library it points to.

   Now, as the root user:

 make install

   If you passed --enable-gtk-doc to the configure script, the API will
   automatically be installed. Otherwise, if desired, you can still install
   the API documentation to the /usr/share/gtk-doc/html/gnutls directory
   using the following command as the root user:

 make -C doc/reference install-data-local

  Command Explanations

   --with-default-trust-store-pkcs11="pkcs11:": This switch tells gnutls to
   use the PKCS #11 trust store as the default trust. Omit this switch if
   p11-kit-0.23.16.1 is not installed.

   --disable-guile: This switch disables GUILE support, since GnuTLS does not
   support Guile-2.2.x yet.

   --with-default-trust-store-file=/etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt: This
   switch tells configure where to find the legacy CA certificate bundle and
   to use it instead of PKCS #11 module by default. Use this if
   p11-kit-0.23.16.1 is not installed.

   --enable-gtk-doc: Use this parameter if GTK-Doc is installed and you wish
   to rebuild and install the API documentation.

   --enable-openssl-compatibility: Use this switch if you wish to build the
   OpenSSL compatibility library.

   --without-p11-kit: use this switch if you have not installed p11-kit.

   --with-included-unistring: uses the bundled version of libunistring,
   instead of the system one. Use this switch if you have not installed
   libunistring-0.9.10.

GPGME-1.13.1

  Introduction to GPGME

   The GPGME package is a C library that allows cryptography support to be
   added to a program. It is designed to make access to public key crypto
   engines like GnuPG or GpgSM easier for applications. GPGME provides a
   high-level crypto API for encryption, decryption, signing, signature
   verification and key management.

   This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS-9.0
   platform.

Iptables-1.8.3

  Introduction to Iptables

   The next part of this chapter deals with firewalls. The principal firewall
   tool for Linux is Iptables. You will need to install Iptables if you
   intend on using any form of a firewall.

   This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS-9.0
   platform.

   User Notes: http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/iptables

  Kernel Configuration

   A firewall in Linux is accomplished through a portion of the kernel called
   netfilter. The interface to netfilter is Iptables. To use it, the
   appropriate kernel configuration parameters are found in:

 [*] Networking support  --->                                    [CONFIG_NET]
       Networking Options  --->
         [*] Network packet filtering framework (Netfilter) ---> [CONFIG_NETFILTER]

  Installation of Iptables

  Note

   The installation below does not include building some specialized
   extension libraries which require the raw headers in the Linux source
   code. If you wish to build the additional extensions (if you aren't sure,
   then you probably don't), you can look at the INSTALL file to see an
   example of how to change the KERNEL_DIR= parameter to point at the Linux
   source code. Note that if you upgrade the kernel version, you may also
   need to recompile Iptables and that the BLFS team has not tested using the
   raw kernel headers.

   For some non-x86 architectures, the raw kernel headers may be required. In
   that case, modify the KERNEL_DIR= parameter to point at the Linux source
   code.

   Install Iptables by running the following commands:

 ./configure --prefix=/usr      \
             --sbindir=/sbin    \
             --disable-nftables \
             --enable-libipq    \
             --with-xtlibdir=/lib/xtables &&
 make

   This package does not come with a test suite.

   Now, as the root user:

 make install &&
 ln -sfv ../../sbin/xtables-legacy-multi /usr/bin/iptables-xml &&

 for file in ip4tc ip6tc ipq iptc xtables
 do
   mv -v /usr/lib/lib${file}.so.* /lib &&
   ln -sfv ../../lib/$(readlink /usr/lib/lib${file}.so) /usr/lib/lib${file}.so
 done

  Command Explanations

   --disable-nftables: This switch disables building nftables compat. Omit
   this switch if you have installed nftables.

   --enable-libipq: This switch enables building of libipq.so which can be
   used by some packages outside of BLFS.

   --with-xtlibdir=/lib/xtables: Ensure all Iptables modules are installed in
   the /lib/xtables directory.

   --enable-nfsynproxy: This switch enables installation of nfsynproxy
   SYNPROXY configuration tool.

   ln -sfv ../../sbin/xtables-legacy-multi /usr/bin/iptables-xml: Ensure the
   symbolic link for iptables-xml is relative.

  Configuring Iptables

   Introductory instructions for configuring your firewall are presented in
   the next section: Firewalling

    Boot Script

   To set up the iptables firewall at boot, install the
   /etc/rc.d/init.d/iptables init script included in the
   blfs-bootscripts-20190609 package.

 make install-iptables

  Contents

   Installed Programs: ip6tables, ip6tables-restore, ip6tables-save,
   iptables, iptables-restore, iptables-save, iptables-xml, nfsynproxy
   (optional) and xtables-multi
   Installed Libraries: libip4tc.so, libip6tc.so, libipq.so, libiptc.so, and
   libxtables.so
   Installed Directories: /lib/xtables and /usr/include/libiptc

    Short Descriptions

   iptables         is used to set up, maintain, and inspect the tables of IP 
                    packet filter rules in the Linux kernel.                  
   iptables-restore is used to restore IP Tables from data specified on       
                    STDIN. Use I/O redirection provided by your shell to read 
                    from a file.                                              
   iptables-save    is used to dump the contents of an IP Table in easily     
                    parseable format to STDOUT. Use I/O-redirection provided  
                    by your shell to write to a file.                         
   iptables-xml     is used to convert the output of iptables-save to an XML  
                    format. Using the iptables.xslt stylesheet converts the   
                    XML back to the format of iptables-restore.               
   ip6tables*       are a set of commands for IPV6 that parallel the iptables 
                    commands above.                                           
   nfsynproxy       (optional) configuration tool. SYNPROXY target makes      
                    handling of large SYN floods possible without the large   
                    performance penalties imposed by the connection tracking  
                    in such cases.

Setting Up a Network Firewall

   Before you read this part of the chapter, you should have already
   installed iptables as described in the previous section.

  Introduction to Firewall Creation

   The general purpose of a firewall is to protect a computer or a network
   against malicious access.

   In a perfect world, every daemon or service on every machine is perfectly
   configured and immune to flaws such as buffer overflows or other problems
   regarding its security. Furthermore, you trust every user accessing your
   services. In this world, you do not need to have a firewall.

   In the real world however, daemons may be misconfigured and exploits
   against essential services are freely available. You may wish to choose
   which services are accessible by certain machines or you may wish to limit
   which machines or applications are allowed external access. Alternatively,
   you may simply not trust some of your applications or users. You are
   probably connected to the Internet. In this world, a firewall is
   essential.

   Don't assume however, that having a firewall makes careful configuration
   redundant, or that it makes any negligent misconfiguration harmless. It
   doesn't prevent anyone from exploiting a service you intentionally offer
   but haven't recently updated or patched after an exploit went public.
   Despite having a firewall, you need to keep applications and daemons on
   your system properly configured and up to date. A firewall is not a cure
   all, but should be an essential part of your overall security strategy.

  Meaning of the Word "Firewall"

   The word firewall can have several different meanings.

    Personal Firewall

   This is a hardware device or software program commercially sold (or
   offered via freeware) by companies such as Symantec which claims that it
   secures a home or desktop computer connected to the Internet. This type of
   firewall is highly relevant for users who do not know how their computers
   might be accessed via the Internet or how to disable that access,
   especially if they are always online and connected via broadband links.

    Masquerading Router

   This is a system placed between the Internet and an intranet. To minimize
   the risk of compromising the firewall itself, it should generally have
   only one roleâthat of protecting the intranet. Although not completely
   risk free, the tasks of doing the routing and IP masquerading (rewriting
   IP headers of the packets it routes from clients with private IP addresses
   onto the Internet so that they seem to come from the firewall itself) are
   commonly considered relatively secure.

    BusyBox

   This is often an old computer you may have retired and nearly forgotten,
   performing masquerading or routing functions, but offering non-firewall
   services such as a web-cache or mail. This may be used for home networks,
   but is not to be considered as secure as a firewall only machine because
   the combination of server and router/firewall on one machine raises the
   complexity of the setup.

    Firewall with a Demilitarized Zone [Not Further Described Here]

   This box performs masquerading or routing, but grants public access to
   some branch of your network which, because of public IPs and a physically
   separated structure, is essentially a separate network with direct
   Internet access. The servers on this network are those which must be
   easily accessible from both the Internet and intranet. The firewall
   protects both networks. This type of firewall has a minimum of three
   network interfaces.

    Packetfilter

   This type of firewall does routing or masquerading, but does not maintain
   a state table of ongoing communication streams. It is fast, but quite
   limited in its ability to block undesired packets without blocking desired
   packets.

  Now You Can Start to Build your Firewall

  Caution

   This introduction on how to setup a firewall is not a complete guide to
   securing systems. Firewalling is a complex issue that requires careful
   configuration. The scripts quoted here are simply intended to give
   examples of how a firewall works. They are not intended to fit into any
   particular configuration and may not provide complete protection from an
   attack.

   Customization of these scripts for your specific situation will be
   necessary for an optimal configuration, but you should make a serious
   study of the iptables documentation and creating firewalls in general
   before hacking away. Have a look at the list of links for further reading
   at the end of this section for more details. There you will find a list of
   URLs that contain quite comprehensive information about building your own
   firewall.

   The firewall configuration script installed in the iptables section
   differs from the standard configuration script. It only has two of the
   standard targets: start and status. The other targets are clear and lock.
   For instance if you issue:

 /etc/rc.d/init.d/iptables start

   the firewall will be restarted just as it is upon system startup. The
   status target will present a list of all currently implemented rules. The
   clear target turns off all firewall rules and the lock target will block
   all packets in and out of the computer with the exception of the loopback
   interface.

   The main startup firewall is located in the file /etc/rc.d/rc.iptables.
   The sections below provide three different approaches that can be used for
   a system.

  Note

   You should always run your firewall rules from a script. This ensures
   consistency and a record of what was done. It also allows retention of
   comments that are essential for understanding the rules long after they
   were written.

    Personal Firewall

   A Personal Firewall is designed to let you access all the services offered
   on the Internet, but keep your box secure and your data private.

   Below is a slightly modified version of Rusty Russell's recommendation
   from the Linux 2.4 Packet Filtering HOWTO. It is still applicable to the
   Linux 2.6 kernels.

 cat > /etc/rc.d/rc.iptables << "EOF"
 #!/bin/sh

 # Begin rc.iptables

 # Insert connection-tracking modules
 # (not needed if built into the kernel)

 modprobe xt_LOG

 # too many routers are still ignorant
 echo 0 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_ecn

 # Set a known state
 iptables -P INPUT   DROP
 iptables -P FORWARD DROP
 iptables -P OUTPUT  DROP

 # These lines are here in case rules are already in place and the
 # script is ever rerun on the fly. We want to remove all rules and
 # pre-existing user defined chains before we implement new rules.
 iptables -F
 iptables -X
 iptables -Z

 iptables -t nat -F

 # Allow local-only connections
 iptables -A INPUT  -i lo -j ACCEPT

 # Free output on any interface to any ip for any service
 # (equal to -P ACCEPT)
 iptables -A OUTPUT -j ACCEPT

 # Permit answers on already established connections
 # and permit new connections related to established ones
 # (e.g. port mode ftp)

 # Log everything else. What's Windows' latest exploitable vulnerability?
 iptables -A INPUT -j LOG --log-prefix "FIREWALL:INPUT "

 # End $rc_base/rc.iptables
 EOF
 chmod 700 /etc/rc.d/rc.iptables

   This script is quite simple, it drops all traffic coming into your
   computer that wasn't initiated from your computer, but as long as you are
   simply surfing the Internet you are unlikely to exceed its limits.

   If you frequently encounter certain delays at accessing FTP servers, take
   a look at BusyBox example number 4.

   Even if you have daemons or services running on your system, these will be
   inaccessible everywhere but from your computer itself. If you want to
   allow access to services on your machine, such as ssh or ping, take a look
   at BusyBox.

    Masquerading Router

   A true Firewall has two interfaces, one connected to an intranet, in this
   example eth0, and one connected to the Internet, here ppp0. To provide the
   maximum security for the firewall itself, make sure that there are no
   unnecessary servers running on it such as X11 et al. As a general
   principle, the firewall itself should not access any untrusted service
   (think of a remote server giving answers that makes a daemon on your
   system crash, or even worse, that implements a worm via a
   buffer-overflow).

   With this script your intranet should be reasonably secure against
   external attacks. No one should be able to setup a new connection to any
   internal service and, if it's masqueraded, makes your intranet invisible
   to the Internet. Furthermore, your firewall should be relatively safe
   because there are no services running that a cracker could attack.

  Note

   If the interface you're connecting to the Internet doesn't connect via
   PPP, you will need to change <ppp+> to the name of the interface (e.g.,
   eth1) which you are using.

    BusyBox

   This scenario isn't too different from the Masquerading Router, but
   additionally offers some services to your intranet. Examples of this can
   be when you want to administer your firewall from another host on your
   intranet or use it as a proxy or a name server.

  Note

   Outlining a true concept of how to protect a server that offers services
   on the Internet goes far beyond the scope of this document. See the
   references at the end of this section for more information.

   Be cautious. Every service you have enabled makes your setup more complex
   and your firewall less secure. You are exposed to the risks of
   misconfigured services or running a service with an exploitable bug. A
   firewall should generally not run any extra services. See the introduction
   to the Masquerading Router for some more details.

   If you want to add services such as internal Samba or name servers that do
   not need to access the Internet themselves, the additional statements are
   quite simple and should still be acceptable from a security standpoint.
   Just add the following lines into the script before the logging rules.

 iptables -A INPUT  -i ! ppp+  -j ACCEPT
 iptables -A OUTPUT -o ! ppp+  -j ACCEPT

   If daemons, such as squid, have to access the Internet themselves, you
   could open OUTPUT generally and restrict INPUT.

 iptables -A INPUT -m conntrack --ctstate ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT
 iptables -A OUTPUT -j ACCEPT

   However, it is generally not advisable to leave OUTPUT unrestricted. You
   lose any control over trojans who would like to "call home", and a bit of
   redundancy in case you've (mis-)configured a service so that it broadcasts
   its existence to the world.

   To accomplish this, you should restrict INPUT and OUTPUT on all ports
   except those that it's absolutely necessary to have open. Which ports you
   have to open depends on your needs: mostly you will find them by looking
   for failed accesses in your log files.

   Have a Look at the Following Examples:

     * Squid is caching the web:

 iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT
 iptables -A INPUT  -p tcp --sport 80 -m conntrack --ctstate ESTABLISHED \
   -j ACCEPT

     * Your caching name server (e.g., named) does its lookups via UDP:

 iptables -A OUTPUT -p udp --dport 53 -j ACCEPT

     * You want to be able to ping your computer to ensure it's still alive:

 iptables -A INPUT  -p icmp -m icmp --icmp-type echo-request -j ACCEPT
 iptables -A OUTPUT -p icmp -m icmp --icmp-type echo-reply   -j ACCEPT

     * If you are frequently accessing FTP servers or enjoy chatting, you
       might notice certain delays because some implementations of these
       daemons have the feature of querying an identd on your system to
       obtain usernames. Although there's really little harm in this, having
       an identd running is not recommended because many security experts
       feel the service gives out too much additional information.

       To avoid these delays you could reject the requests with a
       'tcp-reset':

 iptables -A INPUT  -p tcp --dport 113 -j REJECT --reject-with tcp-reset

     * To log and drop invalid packets (packets that came in after
       netfilter's timeout or some types of network scans) insert these rules
       at the top of the chain:

 iptables -I INPUT 0 -p tcp -m conntrack --ctstate INVALID \
   -j LOG --log-prefix "FIREWALL:INVALID "
 iptables -I INPUT 1 -p tcp -m conntrack --ctstate INVALID -j DROP

     * Anything coming from the outside should not have a private address,
       this is a common attack called IP-spoofing:

 iptables -A INPUT -i ppp+ -s 10.0.0.0/8     -j DROP
 iptables -A INPUT -i ppp+ -s 172.16.0.0/12  -j DROP
 iptables -A INPUT -i ppp+ -s 192.168.0.0/16 -j DROP

       There are other addresses that you may also want to drop: 0.0.0.0/8,
       127.0.0.0/8, 224.0.0.0/3 (multicast and experimental), 169.254.0.0/16
       (Link Local Networks), and 192.0.2.0/24 (IANA defined test network).

     * If your firewall is a DHCP client, you need to allow those packets:

 iptables -A INPUT  -i ppp0 -p udp -s 0.0.0.0 --sport 67 \
    -d 255.255.255.255 --dport 68 -j ACCEPT

     * To simplify debugging and be fair to anyone who'd like to access a
       service you have disabled, purposely or by mistake, you could REJECT
       those packets that are dropped.

       Obviously this must be done directly after logging as the very last
       lines before the packets are dropped by policy:

 iptables -A INPUT -j REJECT

   These are only examples to show you some of the capabilities of the
   firewall code in Linux. Have a look at the man page of iptables. There you
   will find much more information. The port numbers needed for this can be
   found in /etc/services, in case you didn't find them by trial and error in
   your log file.

  Conclusion

   Finally, there is one fact you must not forget: The effort spent attacking
   a system corresponds to the value the cracker expects to gain from it. If
   you are responsible for valuable information, you need to spend the time
   to protect it properly.

libcap-2.27 with PAM

  Introduction to libcap with PAM

   The libcap package was installed in LFS, but if Linux-PAM support is
   desired, the PAM module must be built (after installation of Linux-PAM).

   This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS-9.0
   platform.

    libcap Dependencies

      Required

   Linux-PAM-1.3.1

   User Notes: http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/libcap

  Installation of libcap

   Install libcap by running the following commands:

 make -C pam_cap

   This package does not come with a test suite.

   Now, as the root user:

 install -v -m755 pam_cap/pam_cap.so /lib/security &&
 install -v -m644 pam_cap/capability.conf /etc/security

  Configuring Libcap

   In order to allow Linux-PAM to grant privileges based on POSIX
   capabilites, you need to add the libcap module to the begining of the
   /etc/pam.d/system-auth file. Make the required edits with the following
   commands:

 mv -v /etc/pam.d/system-auth{,.bak} &&
 cat > /etc/pam.d/system-auth << "EOF" &&
 # Begin /etc/pam.d/system-auth

 auth      optional    pam_cap.so
 EOF
 tail -n +3 /etc/pam.d/system-auth.bak >> /etc/pam.d/system-auth

   Additonally, you'll need to modify the /etc/security/capability.conf file
   to grant necessary privileges to users, and utilize the setcap utiltiy to
   set capabilities on specific utilities as needed. See man 8 setcap and man
   3 cap_from_text for additional information.

   Lynx-2.8.9rel.1 or W3m

   User Notes: http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/linux-pam

  Installation of Linux PAM

   If you downloaded the documentation, unpack the tarball by issuing the
   following command.

 tar -xf ../Linux-PAM-1.3.1-docs.tar.xz --strip-components=1

   If you instead want to regenerate the documentation, fix the configure
   script so that it detects lynx if installed:

 sed -e 's/dummy links/dummy lynx/'                                     \
     -e 's/-no-numbering -no-references/-force-html -nonumbers -stdin/' \
     -i configure

   Install Linux PAM by running the following commands:

 ./configure --prefix=/usr                    \
             --sysconfdir=/etc                \
             --libdir=/usr/lib                \
             --enable-securedir=/lib/security \
             --docdir=/usr/share/doc/Linux-PAM-1.3.1 &&
 make

   To test the results, a suitable /etc/pam.d/other configuration file must
   exist.

  Reinstallation or upgrade of Linux PAM

   If you have a system with Linux PAM installed and working, be careful when
   modifying the files in /etc/pam.d, since your system may become totally
   unusable. If you want to run the tests, you do not need to create another
   /etc/pam.d/other file. The installed one can be used for that purpose.

   You should also be aware that make install overwrites the configuration
   files in /etc/security as well as /etc/environment. In case you have
   modified those files, be sure to back them up.

   For a first installation, create the configuration file by issuing the
   following commands as the root user:

 install -v -m755 -d /etc/pam.d &&

 cat > /etc/pam.d/other << "EOF"
 auth     required       pam_deny.so
 account  required       pam_deny.so
 password required       pam_deny.so
 session  required       pam_deny.so
 EOF

   Now run the tests by issuing make check. Ensure there are no errors
   produced by the tests before continuing the installation. Note that the
   checks are quite long. It may be useful to redirect the output to a log
   file in order to inspect it thoroughly.

   Only in case of a first installation, remove the configuration file
   created earlier by issuing the following command as the root user:

 rm -fv /etc/pam.d/*

   Now, as the root user:

 make install &&
 chmod -v 4755 /sbin/unix_chkpwd &&

 for file in pam pam_misc pamc
 do
   mv -v /usr/lib/lib${file}.so.* /lib &&
   ln -sfv ../../lib/$(readlink /usr/lib/lib${file}.so) /usr/lib/lib${file}.so
 done

  Command Explanations

   --enable-securedir=/lib/security: This switch sets install location for
   the PAM modules.

   --disable-regenerate-docu : If the needed dependencies (docbook-xml-4.5,
   docbook-xsl-1.79.2, libxslt-1.1.33, and Lynx-2.8.9rel.1 or W3m) are
   installed, the manual pages, and the html and text documentations are
   (re)generated and installed. Furthermore, if fop-2.3 is installed, the PDF
   documentation is generated and installed. Use this switch if you do not
   want to rebuild the documentation.

   chmod -v 4755 /sbin/unix_chkpwd: The unix_chkpwd helper program must be
   setuid so that non-root processes can access the shadow file.

  Configuring Linux-PAM

    Config Files

   /etc/security/* and /etc/pam.d/*

    Configuration Information

   Configuration information is placed in /etc/pam.d/. Below is an example
   file:

 # Begin /etc/pam.d/other

 auth            required        pam_unix.so     nullok
 account         required        pam_unix.so
 session         required        pam_unix.so
 password        required        pam_unix.so     nullok

 # End /etc/pam.d/other

   Now set up some generic files. As root:

 install -vdm755 /etc/pam.d &&
 cat > /etc/pam.d/system-account << "EOF" &&
 # Begin /etc/pam.d/system-account

 account   required    pam_unix.so

 # End /etc/pam.d/system-account
 EOF

 cat > /etc/pam.d/system-auth << "EOF" &&
 # Begin /etc/pam.d/system-auth

 auth      required    pam_unix.so

 # End /etc/pam.d/system-auth
 EOF

 cat > /etc/pam.d/system-session << "EOF"
 # Begin /etc/pam.d/system-session

 session   required    pam_unix.so

 # End /etc/pam.d/system-session
 EOF

   The remaining generic file depends on whether CrackLib-2.9.7 is installed.
   If it is installed, use:

 cat > /etc/pam.d/system-password << "EOF"
 # Begin /etc/pam.d/system-password

 # check new passwords for strength (man pam_cracklib)
 password  required    pam_cracklib.so    authtok_type=UNIX retry=1 difok=5 \
                                          minlen=9 dcredit=1 ucredit=1 \
                                          lcredit=1 ocredit=1 minclass=0 \
                                          maxrepeat=0 maxsequence=0 \
                                          maxclassrepeat=0 \
                                          dictpath=/lib/cracklib/pw_dict
 # use sha512 hash for encryption, use shadow, and use the
 # authentication token (chosen password) set by pam_cracklib
 # above (or any previous modules)
 password  required    pam_unix.so        sha512 shadow use_authtok

 # End /etc/pam.d/system-password
 EOF

  Note

   In its default configuration, pam_cracklib will allow multiple case
   passwords as short as 6 characters, even with the minlen value set to 11.
   You should review the pam_cracklib(8) man page and determine if these
   default values are acceptable for the security of your system.

   If CrackLib-2.9.7 is NOT installed, use:

 cat > /etc/pam.d/system-password << "EOF"
 # Begin /etc/pam.d/system-password

 # use sha512 hash for encryption, use shadow, and try to use any previously
 # defined authentication token (chosen password) set by any prior module
 password  required    pam_unix.so       sha512 shadow try_first_pass

 # End /etc/pam.d/system-password
 EOF

   Now add a restrictive /etc/pam.d/other configuration file. With this file,
   programs that are PAM aware will not run unless a configuration file
   specifically for that application is created.

 cat > /etc/pam.d/other << "EOF"
 # Begin /etc/pam.d/other

 auth        required        pam_warn.so
 auth        required        pam_deny.so
 account     required        pam_warn.so
 account     required        pam_deny.so
 password    required        pam_warn.so
 password    required        pam_deny.so
 session     required        pam_warn.so
 session     required        pam_deny.so

 # End /etc/pam.d/other
 EOF

   The PAM man page (man pam) provides a good starting point for descriptions
   of fields and allowable entries. The Linux-PAM System Administrators'
   Guide is recommended for additional information.

MIT Kerberos V5-1.17

  Introduction to MIT Kerberos V5

   MIT Kerberos V5 is a free implementation of Kerberos 5. Kerberos is a
   network authentication protocol. It centralizes the authentication
   database and uses kerberized applications to work with servers or services
   that support Kerberos allowing single logins and encrypted communication
   over internal networks or the Internet.

   This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS-9.0
   platform.

    Package Information

     * Download (HTTP): https://kerberos.org/dist/krb5/1.17/krb5-1.17.tar.gz

     * Download MD5 sum: 3b729d89eb441150e146780c4138481b

     * Download size: 8.4 MB

     * Estimated disk space required: 104 MB (add 26 MB for tests)

     * Estimated build time: 0.4 SBU (using parallelism=4; add 2.2 SBU for
       tests)

    MIT Kerberos V5 Dependencies

      Optional

   DejaGnu-1.6.2 (for full test coverage), GnuPG-2.2.17 (to authenticate the
   package), keyutils-1.6, OpenLDAP-2.4.48, rpcbind-1.2.5 (used during the
   testsuite), and Valgrind-3.15.0 (used during the test suite)

  Note

   Some sort of time synchronization facility on your system (like
   ntp-4.2.8p13) is required since Kerberos won't authenticate if there is a
   time difference between a kerberized client and the KDC server.

   User Notes: http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/mitkrb

  Installation of MIT Kerberos V5

   Build MIT Kerberos V5 by running the following commands:

 cd src &&
 
 sed -i -e 's@\^u}@^u cols 300}@' tests/dejagnu/config/default.exp     &&
 sed -i -e '/eq 0/{N;s/12 //}'    plugins/kdb/db2/libdb2/test/run.test &&

 ./configure --prefix=/usr            \
             --sysconfdir=/etc        \
             --localstatedir=/var/lib \
             --with-system-et         \
             --with-system-ss         \
             --with-system-verto=no   \
             --enable-dns-for-realm &&
 make

   To test the build, issue as the root user: make -k check. You need at
   least Tcl-8.6.9, which is used to drive the testsuite. Furthermore,
   DejaGnu-1.6.2 must be available for some of the tests to run. If you have
   a former version of MIT Kerberos V5 installed, it may happen that the test
   suite pick up the installed versions of the libraries, rather than the
   newly built ones. If so, it is better to run the tests after the
   installation. The t_ccselect test is known to fail.

   Now, as the root user:

 make install &&

 for f in gssapi_krb5 gssrpc k5crypto kadm5clnt kadm5srv \
          kdb5 kdb_ldap krad krb5 krb5support verto ; do

     find /usr/lib -type f -name "lib$f*.so*" -exec chmod -v 755 {} \;   
 done          &&

 mv -v /usr/lib/libkrb5.so.3*        /lib &&
 mv -v /usr/lib/libk5crypto.so.3*    /lib &&
 mv -v /usr/lib/libkrb5support.so.0* /lib &&

 ln -v -sf ../../lib/libkrb5.so.3.3        /usr/lib/libkrb5.so        &&
 ln -v -sf ../../lib/libk5crypto.so.3.1    /usr/lib/libk5crypto.so    &&
 ln -v -sf ../../lib/libkrb5support.so.0.1 /usr/lib/libkrb5support.so &&

 mv -v /usr/bin/ksu /bin &&
 chmod -v 755 /bin/ksu   &&

 install -v -dm755 /usr/share/doc/krb5-1.17 &&
 cp -vfr ../doc/*  /usr/share/doc/krb5-1.17

  Command Explanations

   The first sed increases the width of the virtual terminal used for some
   tests to prevent some spurious text in the output which is taken as a
   failure. The second sed removes a test that is known to fail.

   --localstatedir=/var/lib: This option is used so that the Kerberos
   variable run-time data is located in /var/lib instead of /usr/var.

   --with-system-et: This switch causes the build to use the system-installed
   versions of the error-table support software.

   --with-system-ss: This switch causes the build to use the system-installed
   versions of the subsystem command-line interface software.

   --with-system-verto=no: This switch fixes a bug in the package: it does
   not recognize its own verto library installed previously. This is not a
   problem, if reinstalling the same version, but if you are updating, the
   old library is used as system's one, instead of installing the new
   version.

   --enable-dns-for-realm: This switch allows realms to be resolved using the
   DNS server.

   --with-ldap: Use this switch if you want to compile the OpenLDAP database
   backend module.

   mv -v /usr/lib/libk... /lib and ln -v -sf ../../lib/libk...
   /usr/lib/libk...: Move critical libraries to the /lib directory so that
   they are available when the /usr filesystem is not mounted.

   find /usr/lib -type f -name "lib$f*.so*" -exec chmod -v 755 {} \;: This
   command changes the permisison of installed libraries.

   mv -v /usr/bin/ksu /bin: Moves the ksu program to the /bin directory so
   that it is available when the /usr filesystem is not mounted.

  Configuring MIT Kerberos V5

    Config Files

   /etc/krb5.conf and /var/lib/krb5kdc/kdc.conf

    Configuration Information

      Kerberos Configuration

  Tip

   You should consider installing some sort of password checking dictionary
   so that you can configure the installation to only accept strong
   passwords. A suitable dictionary to use is shown in the CrackLib-2.9.7
   instructions. Note that only one file can be used, but you can concatenate
   many files into one. The configuration file shown below assumes you have
   installed a dictionary to /usr/share/dict/words.

   Create the Kerberos configuration file with the following commands issued
   by the root user:

 cat > /etc/krb5.conf << "EOF"
 # Begin /etc/krb5.conf

 [libdefaults]
     default_realm = <EXAMPLE.ORG>
     encrypt = true

 [realms]
     <EXAMPLE.ORG> = {
         kdc = <belgarath.example.org>
         admin_server = <belgarath.example.org>
         dict_file = /usr/share/dict/words
     }

 [domain_realm]
     .<example.org> = <EXAMPLE.ORG>

 [logging]
     kdc = SYSLOG:INFO:AUTH
     admin_server = SYSLOG:INFO:AUTH
     default = SYSLOG:DEBUG:DAEMON

 # End /etc/krb5.conf
 EOF

   You will need to substitute your domain and proper hostname for the
   occurrences of the <belgarath> and <example.org> names.

   default_realm should be the name of your domain changed to ALL CAPS. This
   isn't required, but both Heimdal and MIT recommend it.

   encrypt = true provides encryption of all traffic between kerberized
   clients and servers. It's not necessary and can be left off. If you leave
   it off, you can encrypt all traffic from the client to the server using a
   switch on the client program instead.

   The [realms] parameters tell the client programs where to look for the KDC
   authentication services.

   The [domain_realm] section maps a domain to a realm.

   Create the KDC database:

 kdb5_util create -r <EXAMPLE.ORG> -s

   Now you should populate the database with principals (users). For now,
   just use your regular login name or root.

 kadmin.local
 kadmin.local: add_policy dict-only
 kadmin.local: addprinc -policy dict-only <loginname>

   The KDC server and any machine running kerberized server daemons must have
   a host key installed:

 kadmin.local: addprinc -randkey host/<belgarath.example.org>

   After choosing the defaults when prompted, you will have to export the
   data to a keytab file:

 kadmin.local: ktadd host/<belgarath.example.org>

   This should have created a file in /etc named krb5.keytab (Kerberos 5).
   This file should have 600 (root rw only) permissions. Keeping the keytab
   files from public access is crucial to the overall security of the
   Kerberos installation.

   Exit the kadmin program (use quit or exit) and return back to the shell
   prompt. Start the KDC daemon manually, just to test out the installation:

 /usr/sbin/krb5kdc

   Attempt to get a ticket with the following command:

 kinit <loginname>

   You will be prompted for the password you created. After you get your
   ticket, you can list it with the following command:

 klist

   Information about the ticket should be displayed on the screen.

   To test the functionality of the keytab file, issue the following command:

 ktutil
 ktutil: rkt /etc/krb5.keytab
 ktutil: l

   This should dump a list of the host principal, along with the encryption
   methods used to access the principal.

   At this point, if everything has been successful so far, you can feel
   fairly confident in the installation and configuration of the package.

      Additional Information

   For additional information consult the documentation for krb5-1.17 on
   which the above instructions are based.

    Init Script

   If you want to start Kerberos services at boot, install the
   /etc/rc.d/init.d/krb5 init script included in the
   blfs-bootscripts-20190609 package using the following command:

   Installed Libraries: libhogweed.so and libnettle.so
   Installed Directory: /usr/include/nettle and /usr/share/doc/nettle-3.5.1

    Short Descriptions

   nettle-hash        calculates a hash value using a specified algorithm.    
   nettle-lfib-stream outputs a sequence of pseudorandom (non-cryptographic)  
                      bytes, using Knuth's lagged fibonacci generator. The    
                      stream is useful for testing, but should not be used to 
                      generate cryptographic keys or anything else that needs 
                      real randomness.                                        
   nettle-pbkdf2      password-based key derivation function that take as     
                      input a password or passphrase and typically strengthen 
                      it and protect against certain pre-computation attacks  
                      by using salting and expensive computation.             
   pkcs1-conv         converts private and public RSA keys from PKCS #1       
                      format to sexp format.                                  
   sexp-conv          converts an s-expression to a different encoding.

NSS-3.45

  Introduction to NSS

   The Network Security Services (NSS) package is a set of libraries designed
   to support cross-platform development of security-enabled client and
   server applications. Applications built with NSS can support SSL v2 and
   v3, TLS, PKCS #5, PKCS #7, PKCS #11, PKCS #12, S/MIME, X.509 v3
   certificates, and other security standards. This is useful for
   implementing SSL and S/MIME or other Internet security standards into an
   application.

   This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS-9.0
   platform.

      Recommended

   SQLite-3.29.0 and p11-kit-0.23.16.1 (runtime)

   User Notes: http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/nss

  Installation of NSS

  Note

   This package does not support parallel build.

   Install NSS by running the following commands:

 patch -Np1 -i ../nss-3.45-standalone-1.patch &&

 cd nss &&

 make -j1 BUILD_OPT=1                  \
   NSPR_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/include/nspr  \
   USE_SYSTEM_ZLIB=1                   \
   ZLIB_LIBS=-lz                       \
   NSS_ENABLE_WERROR=0                 \
   $([ $(uname -m) = x86_64 ] && echo USE_64=1) \
   $([ -f /usr/include/sqlite3.h ] && echo NSS_USE_SYSTEM_SQLITE=1)

   The testsuite is designed for testing changes to nss or nspr and is not
   particularly useful for checking a released version (e.g. it needs to be
   run on a non-optimized build with both nss and nspr directories existing
   alongside each other). For further details, see the User Notes.

   Now, as the root user:

 cd ../dist                                                          &&

 install -v -m755 Linux*/lib/*.so              /usr/lib              &&
 install -v -m644 Linux*/lib/{*.chk,libcrmf.a} /usr/lib              &&

 install -v -m755 -d                           /usr/include/nss      &&
 cp -v -RL {public,private}/nss/*              /usr/include/nss      &&
 chmod -v 644                                  /usr/include/nss/*    &&

 install -v -m755 Linux*/bin/{certutil,nss-config,pk12util} /usr/bin &&

 install -v -m644 Linux*/lib/pkgconfig/nss.pc  /usr/lib/pkgconfig

  Command Explanations

   BUILD_OPT=1: This option is passed to make so that the build is performed
   with no debugging symbols built into the binaries and the default compiler
   optimizations are used.

   NSPR_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/include/nspr: This option sets the location of the
   nspr headers.

   USE_SYSTEM_ZLIB=1: This option is passed to make to ensure that the
   libssl3.so library is linked to the system installed zlib instead of the
   in-tree version.

   ZLIB_LIBS=-lz: This option provides the linker flags needed to link to the
   system zlib.

   $([ $(uname -m) = x86_64 ] && echo USE_64=1): The USE_64=1 option is
   required on x86_64, otherwise make will try (and fail) to create 32-bit
   objects. The [ $(uname -m) = x86_64 ] test ensures it has no effect on a
   32 bit system.

   ([ -f /usr/include/sqlite3.h ] && echo NSS_USE_SYSTEM_SQLITE=1): This
   tests if sqlite is installed and if so it echos the option
   NSS_USE_SYSTEM_SQLITE=1 to make so that libsoftokn3.so will link against
   the system version of sqlite.

  Configuring NSS

   If p11-kit-0.23.16.1 is installed, the p11-kit trust module
   (/usr/lib/pkcs11/p11-kit-trust.so) can be used as a drop-in replacement
   for /usr/lib/libnssckbi.so to transparently make the system CAs available
   to NSS aware applications, rather than the static list provided by
   /usr/lib/libnssckbi.so. As the root user, execute the following commands:

 ln -sfv ./pkcs11/p11-kit-trust.so /usr/lib/libnssckbi.so

   Additionally, for dependent applications that do not use the internal
   database (/usr/lib/libnssckbi.so), the /usr/sbin/make-ca script, included
   on the make-ca-1.4 page can generate a system wide NSS DB with the -n
   switch, or by modifying the /etc/make-ca.conf file.

   libssl3.so
   Installed Directories: /usr/include/nss

    Short Descriptions

   certutil   is the Mozilla Certificate Database Tool. It is a command-line  
              utility that can create and modify the Netscape Communicator    
              cert8.db and key3.db database files. It can also list,          
              generate, modify, or delete certificates within the cert8.db    
              file and create or change the password, generate new public and 
              private key pairs, display the contents of the key database, or 
              delete key pairs within the key3.db file.                       
   nss-config is used to determine the NSS library settings of the installed  
              NSS libraries.                                                  
   pk12util   is a tool for importing certificates and keys from pkcs #12     
              files into NSS or exporting them. It can also list certificates 
              and keys in such files.

OpenSSH-8.0p1

  Introduction to OpenSSH

   The OpenSSH package contains ssh clients and the sshd daemon. This is
   useful for encrypting authentication and subsequent traffic over a
   network. The ssh and scp commands are secure implementations of telnet and
   rcp respectively.

   This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS-9.0
   platform.

   User Notes: http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/OpenSSH

  Installation of OpenSSH

   OpenSSH runs as two processes when connecting to other computers. The
   first process is a privileged process and controls the issuance of
   privileges as necessary. The second process communicates with the network.
   Additional installation steps are necessary to set up the proper
   environment, which are performed by issuing the following commands as the
   root user:

 install  -v -m700 -d /var/lib/sshd &&
 chown    -v root:sys /var/lib/sshd &&

 groupadd -g 50 sshd        &&
 useradd  -c 'sshd PrivSep' \
          -d /var/lib/sshd  \
          -g sshd           \
          -s /bin/false     \
          -u 50 sshd

   Install OpenSSH by running the following commands:

 ./configure --prefix=/usr                     \
             --sysconfdir=/etc/ssh             \
             --with-md5-passwords              \
             --with-privsep-path=/var/lib/sshd &&
 make

   The testsuite requires an installed copy of scp to complete the
   multiplexing tests. To run the test suite, first copy the scp program to
   /usr/bin, making sure that you backup any existing copy first.

   To test the results, issue: make tests.

   Now, as the root user:

 make install &&
 install -v -m755    contrib/ssh-copy-id /usr/bin     &&

 install -v -m644    contrib/ssh-copy-id.1 \
                     /usr/share/man/man1              &&
 install -v -m755 -d /usr/share/doc/openssh-8.0p1     &&
 install -v -m644    INSTALL LICENCE OVERVIEW README* \
                     /usr/share/doc/openssh-8.0p1

  Command Explanations

   --sysconfdir=/etc/ssh: This prevents the configuration files from being
   installed in /usr/etc.

   --with-md5-passwords: This enables the use of MD5 passwords.

   --with-pam: This parameter enables Linux-PAM support in the build.

   --with-xauth=/usr/bin/xauth: Set the default location for the xauth binary
   for X authentication. Change the location if xauth will be installed to a
   different path. This can also be controlled from sshd_config with the
   XAuthLocation keyword. You can omit this switch if Xorg is already
   installed.

   --with-kerberos5=/usr: This option is used to include Kerberos 5 support
   in the build.

   --with-libedit: This option enables line editing and history features for
   sftp.

  Configuring OpenSSH

    Config Files

   ~/.ssh/*, /etc/ssh/ssh_config, and /etc/ssh/sshd_config

   There are no required changes to any of these files. However, you may wish
   to view the /etc/ssh/ files and make any changes appropriate for the
   security of your system. One recommended change is that you disable root
   login via ssh. Execute the following command as the root user to disable
   root login via ssh:

 echo "PermitRootLogin no" >> /etc/ssh/sshd_config

   If you want to be able to log in without typing in your password, first
   create ~/.ssh/id_rsa and ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub with ssh-keygen and then copy
   ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub to ~/.ssh/authorized_keys on the remote computer that
   you want to log into. You'll need to change REMOTE_USERNAME and
   REMOTE_HOSTNAME for the username and hostname of the remote computer and
   you'll also need to enter your password for the ssh-copy-id command to
   succeed:

 ssh-keygen &&
 ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub REMOTE_USERNAME@REMOTE_HOSTNAME

   Once you've got passwordless logins working it's actually more secure than
   logging in with a password (as the private key is much longer than most
   people's passwords). If you would like to now disable password logins, as
   the root user:

 echo "PasswordAuthentication no" >> /etc/ssh/sshd_config &&
 echo "ChallengeResponseAuthentication no" >> /etc/ssh/sshd_config

   If you added Linux-PAM support and you want ssh to use it then you will
   need to add a configuration file for sshd and enable use of LinuxPAM.
   Note, ssh only uses PAM to check passwords, if you've disabled password
   logins these commands are not needed. If you want to use PAM, issue the
   following commands as the root user:

 sed 's@d/login@d/sshd@g' /etc/pam.d/login > /etc/pam.d/sshd &&
 chmod 644 /etc/pam.d/sshd &&
 echo "UsePAM yes" >> /etc/ssh/sshd_config

   Additional configuration information can be found in the man pages for
   sshd, ssh and ssh-agent.

    Boot Script

   To start the SSH server at system boot, install the /etc/rc.d/init.d/sshd
   init script included in the blfs-bootscripts-20190609 package.

 make install-sshd

   GTK-Doc-1.32, libxslt-1.1.33, and NSS-3.45 (runtime)

   User Notes: http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/p11-kit

  Installation of p11-kit

   Prepare the distribution specific anchor hook:

 sed '20,$ d' -i trust/trust-extract-compat.in &&
 cat >> trust/trust-extract-compat.in << "EOF"
 # Copy existing anchor modifications to /etc/ssl/local
 /usr/libexec/make-ca/copy-trust-modifications

 # Generate a new trust store
 /usr/sbin/make-ca -f -g
 EOF

   Install p11-kit by running the following commands:

 ./configure --prefix=/usr     \
             --sysconfdir=/etc \
             --with-trust-paths=/etc/pki/anchors &&
 make

   To test the results, issue: make check.

   Now, as the root user:

 make install &&
 ln -sfv /usr/libexec/p11-kit/trust-extract-compat \
         /usr/bin/update-ca-certificates

  Command Explanations

   --with-trust-paths=/etc/pki/anchors: this switch sets the location of
   trusted certificates used by libp11-kit.so.

   --with-hash-impl=freebl: Use this switch if you want to use the Freebl
   library from NSS for SHA1 and MD5 hashing.

   --enable-doc: Use this switch if you have installed GTK-Doc-1.32 and
   libxslt-1.1.33 and wish to rebuild the documentation and generate manual
   pages.

  Configuring p11-kit

   The p11-kit trust module (/usr/lib/pkcs11/p11-kit-trust.so) can be used as
   a drop-in replacement for /usr/lib/libnssckbi.so to transparently make the
   system CAs available to NSS aware applications, rather than the static

Polkit-0.116

  Introduction to Polkit

   Polkit is a toolkit for defining and handling authorizations. It is used
   for allowing unprivileged processes to communicate with privileged
   processes.

   This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS-9.0
   platform.

    Polkit Dependencies

      Required

   GLib-2.60.6 and js60-60.8.0

      Recommended

   Linux-PAM-1.3.1 and elogind-241.3

  Note

   Since elogind uses PAM to register user sessions, it is a good idea to
   build Polkit with PAM support so elogind can track Polkit sessions.

      Optional (Required if building GNOME)

   gobject-introspection-1.60.2

      Optional

   docbook-xml-4.5, docbook-xsl-1.79.2, GTK-Doc-1.32, and libxslt-1.1.33

  Note

   If libxslt-1.1.33 is installed, then docbook-xml-4.5 and
   docbook-xsl-1.79.2 are required. If you have installed libxslt-1.1.33, but
   you do not want to install any of the DocBook packages mentioned, you will
   need to use --disable-man-pages in the instructions below.

   User Notes: http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/polkit

  Installation of Polkit

   There should be a dedicated user and group to take control of the polkitd
   daemon after it is started. Issue the following commands as the root user:

 groupadd -fg 27 polkitd &&
 useradd -c "PolicyKit Daemon Owner" -d /etc/polkit-1 -u 27 \
         -g polkitd -s /bin/false polkitd

   Fix an issue introduced in recent Polkit realeases with elogind:

 patch -Np1 -i ../polkit-0.116-fix_elogind_detection-1.patch &&
 autoreconf -fi

   Install Polkit by running the following commands:

 ./configure --prefix=/usr        \
             --sysconfdir=/etc    \
             --localstatedir=/var \
             --disable-static     \
             --with-os-type=LFS   \
             --enable-libsystemd-login=no &&
 make

   To test the results, issue: make check. Note that system D-Bus daemon must
   be running for the testsuite to complete.

   Now, as the root user:

 make install

  Command Explanations

   --with-authfw=shadow: This switch enables the package to use the Shadow
   rather than the Linux PAM Authentication framework. Use it if you have not
   installed Linux PAM.

   --disable-static: This switch prevents installation of static versions of
   the libraries.

   --enable-gtk-doc: Use this parameter if GTK-Doc is installed and you wish
   to rebuild and install the API documentation.

   --enable-libsystemd-login=no: This switch forces polkit to build with
   elogind support (if available) rather than systemd.

  Configuring Polkit

    PAM Configuration

  Note

   If you did not build Polkit with Linux PAM support, you can skip this
   section.

   If you have built Polkit with Linux PAM support, you need to modify the
   default PAM configuration file which was installed by default to get
   Polkit to work correctly with BLFS. Issue the following commands as the
   root user to create the configuration file for Linux PAM:

 cat > /etc/pam.d/polkit-1 << "EOF"
 # Begin /etc/pam.d/polkit-1

 auth     include        system-auth
 account  include        system-account
 password include        system-password
 session  include        system-session

 # End /etc/pam.d/polkit-1
 EOF

    Short Descriptions

   pkaction               is used to obtain information about registered      
                          PolicyKit actions.                                  
   pkcheck                is used to check whether a process is authorized    
                          for action.                                         
   pk-example-frobnicate  is an example program to test the pkexec command.   
   pkexec                 allows an authorized user to execute a command as   
                          another user.                                       
   pkttyagent             is used to start a textual authentication agent for

Shadow-4.7

  Introduction to Shadow

   Shadow was indeed installed in LFS and there is no reason to reinstall it
   unless you installed CrackLib or Linux-PAM after your LFS system was
   completed. If you have installed CrackLib after LFS, then reinstalling
   Shadow will enable strong password support. If you have installed
   Linux-PAM, reinstalling Shadow will allow programs such as login and su to
   utilize PAM.

   This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS-9.0
   platform.

     * Download size: 1.6 MB

     * Estimated disk space required: 33 MB

     * Estimated build time: 0.2 SBU

    Shadow Dependencies

      Required

   Linux-PAM-1.3.1 or CrackLib-2.9.7

   User Notes: http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/shadow

  Installation of Shadow

  Important

   The installation commands shown below are for installations where
   Linux-PAM has been installed (with or without a CrackLib installation) and
   Shadow is being reinstalled to support the Linux-PAM installation.

   If you are reinstalling Shadow to provide strong password support using
   the CrackLib library without using Linux-PAM, ensure you add the
   --with-libcrack parameter to the configure script below and also issue the
   following command:

 sed -i 's@DICTPATH.*@DICTPATH\t/lib/cracklib/pw_dict@' etc/login.defs

   Reinstall Shadow by running the following commands:

 sed -i 's/groups$(EXEEXT) //' src/Makefile.in &&

 find man -name Makefile.in -exec sed -i 's/groups\.1 / /'   {} \; &&
 find man -name Makefile.in -exec sed -i 's/getspnam\.3 / /' {} \; &&
 find man -name Makefile.in -exec sed -i 's/passwd\.5 / /'   {} \; &&

 sed -i -e 's@#ENCRYPT_METHOD DES@ENCRYPT_METHOD SHA512@' \
        -e 's@/var/spool/mail@/var/mail@' etc/login.defs &&

 sed -i 's/1000/999/' etc/useradd                           &&

 ./configure --sysconfdir=/etc --with-group-name-max-length=32 &&
 make

   This package does not come with a test suite.

   Now, as the root user:

 make install &&
 mv -v /usr/bin/passwd /bin

  Command Explanations

   sed -i 's/groups$(EXEEXT) //' src/Makefile.in: This sed is used to
   suppress the installation of the groups program as the version from the
   Coreutils package installed during LFS is preferred.

   find man -name Makefile.in -exec ... {} \;: This command is used to
   suppress the installation of the groups man pages so the existing ones
   installed from the Coreutils package are not replaced.

   sed -i -e 's@#ENCRYPT_METHOD DES@ENCRYPT_METHOD SHA512@' -e
   's@/var/spool/mail@/var/mail@' etc/login.defs: Instead of using the
   default 'DES' method, this command modifies the installation to use the
   more secure 'SHA512' method of hashing passwords, which also allows
   passwords longer than eight characters. It also changes the obsolete
   /var/spool/mail location for user mailboxes that Shadow uses by default to
   the /var/mail location.

   sed -i 's/1000/999/' etc/useradd: Make a minor change to make the default
   useradd consistent with the LFS groups file.

   --with-group-name-max-length=32: The maximum user name is 32 characters.
   Make the maximum group name the same.

   mv -v /usr/bin/passwd /bin: The passwd program may be needed during times
   when the /usr filesystem is not mounted so it is moved into the root
   partition.

  Configuring Shadow

   Shadow's stock configuration for the useradd utility may not be desirable
   for your installation. One default parameter causes useradd to create a
   mailbox file for any newly created user. useradd will make the group
   ownership of this file to the mail group with 0660 permissions. If you
   would prefer that these mailbox files are not created by useradd, issue
   the following command as the root user:

 sed -i 's/yes/no/' /etc/default/useradd

  Configuring Linux-PAM to Work with Shadow

  Note

   The rest of this page is devoted to configuring Shadow to work properly
   with Linux-PAM. If you do not have Linux-PAM installed, and you
   reinstalled Shadow to support strong passwords via the CrackLib library,
   no further configuration is required.

    Config Files

   /etc/pam.d/* or alternatively /etc/pam.conf, /etc/login.defs and
   /etc/security/*

    Configuration Information

   Configuring your system to use Linux-PAM can be a complex task. The
   information below will provide a basic setup so that Shadow's login and
   password functionality will work effectively with Linux-PAM. Review the
   information and links on the Linux-PAM-1.3.1 page for further
   configuration information. For information specific to integrating Shadow,
   Linux-PAM and CrackLib, you can visit the following link:

     * http://www.deer-run.com/~hal/linux_passwords_pam.html

      Configuring /etc/login.defs

   The login program currently performs many functions which Linux-PAM
   modules should now handle. The following sed command will comment out the
   appropriate lines in /etc/login.defs, and stop login from performing these
   functions (a backup file named /etc/login.defs.orig is also created to
   preserve the original file's contents). Issue the following commands as
   the root user:

 install -v -m644 /etc/login.defs /etc/login.defs.orig &&
 for FUNCTION in FAIL_DELAY               \
                 FAILLOG_ENAB             \
                 LASTLOG_ENAB             \
                 MAIL_CHECK_ENAB          \
                 OBSCURE_CHECKS_ENAB      \
                 PORTTIME_CHECKS_ENAB     \
                 QUOTAS_ENAB              \
                 CONSOLE MOTD_FILE        \
                 FTMP_FILE NOLOGINS_FILE  \
                 ENV_HZ PASS_MIN_LEN      \
                 SU_WHEEL_ONLY            \
                 CRACKLIB_DICTPATH        \
                 PASS_CHANGE_TRIES        \
                 PASS_ALWAYS_WARN         \
                 CHFN_AUTH ENCRYPT_METHOD \
                 ENVIRON_FILE
 do
     sed -i "s/^${FUNCTION}/# &/" /etc/login.defs
 done

      Configuring the /etc/pam.d/ Files

   As mentioned previously in the Linux-PAM instructions, Linux-PAM has two
   supported methods for configuration. The commands below assume that you've
   chosen to use a directory based configuration, where each program has its
   own configuration file. You can optionally use a single /etc/pam.conf
   configuration file by using the text from the files below, and supplying
   the program name as an additional first field for each line.

   As the root user, replace the following Linux-PAM configuration files in
   the /etc/pam.d/ directory (or add the contents to the /etc/pam.conf file)
   using the following commands:

      'login'

 cat > /etc/pam.d/login << "EOF"
 # Begin /etc/pam.d/login

 # Set failure delay before next prompt to 3 seconds
 auth      optional    pam_faildelay.so  delay=3000000

 # Check to make sure that the user is allowed to login
 auth      requisite   pam_nologin.so

 # Check to make sure that root is allowed to login
 # Disabled by default. You will need to create /etc/securetty
 # file for this module to function. See man 5 securetty.
 #auth      required    pam_securetty.so

 # Additional group memberships - disabled by default
 #auth      optional    pam_group.so

 # include system auth settings
 auth      include     system-auth

 # check access for the user
 account   required    pam_access.so

 # include system account settings
 account   include     system-account

 # Set default environment variables for the user
 session   required    pam_env.so

 # Set resource limits for the user
 session   required    pam_limits.so

 # Display date of last login - Disabled by default
 #session   optional    pam_lastlog.so

 # Display the message of the day - Disabled by default
 #session   optional    pam_motd.so

 # Check user's mail - Disabled by default
 #session   optional    pam_mail.so      standard quiet

 # include system session and password settings
 session   include     system-session
 password  include     system-password

 # End /etc/pam.d/login
 EOF

      'passwd'

 cat > /etc/pam.d/passwd << "EOF"
 # Begin /etc/pam.d/passwd

 password  include     system-password

 # End /etc/pam.d/passwd
 EOF

      'su'

 cat > /etc/pam.d/su << "EOF"
 # Begin /etc/pam.d/su

 # always allow root
 auth      sufficient  pam_rootok.so

 # Allow users in the wheel group to execute su without a password
 # disabled by default
 #auth      sufficient  pam_wheel.so trust use_uid

 # include system auth settings
 auth      include     system-auth

 # limit su to users in the wheel group
 auth      required    pam_wheel.so use_uid

 # include system account settings
 account   include     system-account

 # Set default environment variables for the service user
 session   required    pam_env.so

 # include system session settings
 session   include     system-session

 # End /etc/pam.d/su
 EOF

      'chage'

 cat > /etc/pam.d/chage << "EOF"
 # Begin /etc/pam.d/chage

 # always allow root
 auth      sufficient  pam_rootok.so

 # include system auth, account, and session settings
 auth      include     system-auth
 account   include     system-account
 session   include     system-session

 # Always permit for authentication updates
 password  required    pam_permit.so

 # End /etc/pam.d/chage
 EOF

      Other common programs

 for PROGRAM in chfn chgpasswd chpasswd chsh groupadd groupdel \
                groupmems groupmod newusers useradd userdel usermod
 do
     install -v -m644 /etc/pam.d/chage /etc/pam.d/${PROGRAM}
     sed -i "s/chage/$PROGRAM/" /etc/pam.d/${PROGRAM}
 done

  Warning

   At this point, you should do a simple test to see if Shadow is working as
   expected. Open another terminal and log in as a user, then su to root. If
   you do not see any errors, then all is well and you should proceed with
   the rest of the configuration. If you did receive errors, stop now and
   double check the above configuration files manually. One obvious reason
   for an error is if the user is not in group wheel. You may want to run (as
   root): usermod -a -G wheel <user>. Any other error is the sign of an error
   in the above procedure. You can also run the test suite from the Linux-PAM
   package to assist you in determining the problem. If you cannot find and
   fix the error, you should recompile Shadow adding the --without-libpam
   switch to the configure command in the above instructions (also move the
   /etc/login.defs.orig backup file to /etc/login.defs). If you fail to do
   this and the errors remain, you will be unable to log into your system.

      Configuring Login Access

   Instead of using the /etc/login.access file for controlling access to the
   system, Linux-PAM uses the pam_access.so module along with the
   /etc/security/access.conf file. Rename the /etc/login.access file using
   the following command:

 [ -f /etc/login.access ] && mv -v /etc/login.access{,.NOUSE}

      Configuring Resource Limits

   Instead of using the /etc/limits file for limiting usage of system
   resources, Linux-PAM uses the pam_limits.so module along with the
   /etc/security/limits.conf file. Rename the /etc/limits file using the
   following command:

 [ -f /etc/limits ] && mv -v /etc/limits{,.NOUSE}

  Caution

   Be sure to test the login capabilities of the system before logging out.
   Errors in the configuration can cause a permanent lockout requiring a boot
   from an external source to correct the problem.

ssh-askpass-8.0p1

  Introduction to ssh-askpass

   The ssh-askpass is a generic executable name for many packages, with
   similar names, that provide a interactive X service to grab password for
   packages requiring administrative privileges to be run. It prompts the
   user with a window box where the necessary password can be inserted. Here,
   we choose Damien Miller's package distributed in the OpenSSH tarball.

   This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS-9.0
   platform.

    ssh-askpass Dependencies

      Required

   GTK+-2.24.32, Sudo-1.8.27 (runtime), Xorg Libraries, and X Window System
   (runtime)

   User Notes: http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/ssh-askpass

  Installation of ssh-askpass

   Install ssh-askpass by running the following commands:

 cd contrib &&
 make gnome-ssh-askpass2

   Now, as the root user:

 install -v -d -m755 /usr/libexec/openssh/contrib  &&
 install -v -m755    gnome-ssh-askpass2 \
                     /usr/libexec/openssh/contrib  &&
 ln -sv -f contrib/gnome-ssh-askpass2 \
                     /usr/libexec/openssh/ssh-askpass

   The use of /usr/libexec/openssh/contrib and a symlink is justified by the
   eventual necessity of a different program for that service.

  Configuring ssh-askpass

    Configuration Information

   As the root user, configure Sudo-1.8.27 to use ssh-askpass:

 cat >> /etc/sudo.conf << "EOF" &&
 # Path to askpass helper program
 Path askpass /usr/libexec/openssh/ssh-askpass
 EOF
 chmod -v 0644 /etc/sudo.conf

   If a given graphical <application> requires administrative privileges, use
   sudo -A <application> from an x-terminal, from a Window Manager menu
   and/or replace "Exec=<application> ..." by "Exec=sudo -A <application>
   ..." in the <application>.desktop file.

stunnel-5.55

  Introduction to stunnel

   The stunnel package contains a program that allows you to encrypt
   arbitrary TCP connections inside SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) so you can
   easily communicate with clients over secure channels. stunnel can be used
   to add SSL functionality to commonly used Inetd daemons such as POP-2,
   POP-3, and IMAP servers, along with standalone daemons such as NNTP, SMTP,
   and HTTP. stunnel can also be used to tunnel PPP over network sockets
   without changes to the server package source code.

   This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS-9.0
   platform.

     * Estimated build time: 0.1 SBU

    stunnel Dependencies

      Optional

   netcat (required for tests), tcpwrappers and TOR

   User Notes: http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/stunnel

  Installation of stunnel

   The stunnel daemon will be run in a chroot jail by an unprivileged user.
   Create the new user and group using the following commands as the root
   user:

 groupadd -g 51 stunnel &&
 useradd -c "stunnel Daemon" -d /var/lib/stunnel \
         -g stunnel -s /bin/false -u 51 stunnel

  Note

   A signed SSL Certificate and a Private Key is necessary to run the stunnel
   daemon. After the package is installed, there are instructions to generate
   them. However, if you own or have already created a signed SSL Certificate
   you wish to use, copy it to /etc/stunnel/stunnel.pem before starting the
   build (ensure only root has read and write access). The .pem file must be
   formatted as shown below:

 -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
 <many encrypted lines of private key>
 -----END PRIVATE KEY-----
 -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
 <many encrypted lines of certificate>
 -----END CERTIFICATE-----
 -----BEGIN DH PARAMETERS-----
 <encrypted lines of dh parms>
 -----END DH PARAMETERS-----

   Install stunnel by running the following commands:

  Note

   For some systems with binutils versions prior to 2.25, configure may fail.
   If necessary, fix it either with:

 sed -i '/LDFLAGS.*static_flag/ s/^/#/' configure

   or, if LLVM-8.0.1 with Clang is installed, you can replace ./configure ...
   with CC=clang ./configure ... in the first command below.

 ./configure --prefix=/usr        \
             --sysconfdir=/etc    \
             --localstatedir=/var \
             --disable-systemd    &&
 make

   If you have installed the optional netcat application, the regression
   tests can be run with make check.

   Now, as the root user:

 make docdir=/usr/share/doc/stunnel-5.55 install

   If you do not already have a signed SSL Certificate and Private Key,
   create the stunnel.pem file in the /etc/stunnel directory using the
   command below. You will be prompted to enter the necessary information.
   Ensure you reply to the

 Common Name (FQDN of your server) [localhost]:

   prompt with the name or IP address you will be using to access the
   service(s).

   To generate a certificate, as the root user, issue:

 make cert

  Command Explanations

   --disable-systemd: This switch disables systemd socket activation support
   which is not available in BLFS.

   make docdir=... install: This command installs the package and changes the
   documentation installation directory to standard naming conventions.

  Configuring stunnel

    Config Files

   /etc/stunnel/stunnel.conf

    Configuration Information

   As the root user, create the directory used for the .pid file created when
   the stunnel daemon starts:

 install -v -m750 -o stunnel -g stunnel -d /var/lib/stunnel/run &&
 chown stunnel:stunnel /var/lib/stunnel

   Next, create a basic /etc/stunnel/stunnel.conf configuration file using
   the following commands as the root user:

 cat >/etc/stunnel/stunnel.conf << "EOF"
 ; File: /etc/stunnel/stunnel.conf

 ; Note: The pid and output locations are relative to the chroot location.

 pid    = /run/stunnel.pid
 chroot = /var/lib/stunnel
 client = no
 setuid = stunnel
 setgid = stunnel
 cert   = /etc/stunnel/stunnel.pem

 ;debug = 7
 ;output = stunnel.log

 ;[https]
 ;accept  = 443
 ;connect = 80
 ;; "TIMEOUTclose = 0" is a workaround for a design flaw in Microsoft SSL
 ;; Microsoft implementations do not use SSL close-notify alert and thus
 ;; they are vulnerable to truncation attacks
 ;TIMEOUTclose = 0

 EOF

   Finally, add the service(s) you wish to encrypt to the configuration file.
   The format is as follows:

 [<service>]
 accept  = <hostname:portnumber>
 connect = <hostname:portnumber>

   If you use stunnel to encrypt a daemon started from [x]inetd, you may need
   to disable that daemon in the /etc/[x]inetd.conf file and enable a
   corresponding <service>_stunnel service. You may have to add an
   appropriate entry in /etc/services as well.

   For a full explanation of the commands and syntax used in the
   configuration file, issue man stunnel.

    Boot Script

   To automatically start the stunnel daemon when the system is booted,
   install the /etc/rc.d/init.d/stunnel bootscript from the
   blfs-bootscripts-20190609 package.

 make install-stunnel

  Contents

   Installed Programs: stunnel and stunnel3
   Installed Library: libstunnel.so
   Installed Directories: /{etc,usr/lib,var/lib}/stunnel and

    Short Descriptions

   stunnel       is a program designed to work as an SSL encryption wrapper   
                 between remote clients and local ({x}inetd-startable) or     
                 remote servers.                                              
   stunnel3      is a Perl wrapper script to use stunnel 3.x syntax with      
                 stunnel >=4.05.                                              
   libstunnel.so contains the API functions required by stunnel.

Sudo-1.8.27

  Introduction to Sudo

   The Sudo package allows a system administrator to give certain users (or
   groups of users) the ability to run some (or all) commands as root or
   another user while logging the commands and arguments.

   This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS-9.0
   platform.

     * Download size: 3.1 MB

     * Estimated disk space required: 38 MB (with tests)

     * Estimated build time: 0.4 SBU (with tests)

    Sudo Dependencies

      Optional

   Linux-PAM-1.3.1, MIT Kerberos V5-1.17, OpenLDAP-2.4.48, MTA (that provides
   a sendmail command), AFS, FWTK, and Opie

   User Notes: http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/sudo

  Installation of Sudo

   Install Sudo by running the following commands:

 ./configure --prefix=/usr              \
             --libexecdir=/usr/lib      \
             --with-secure-path         \
             --with-all-insults         \
             --with-env-editor          \
             --docdir=/usr/share/doc/sudo-1.8.27 \
             --with-passprompt="[sudo] password for %p: " &&
 make

   To test the results, issue: env LC_ALL=C make check 2>&1 | tee
   ../make-check.log. Check the results with grep failed ../make-check.log.
   One test, test3, is known to fail if the tests are run as the root user.

   Now, as the root user:

 make install &&
 ln -sfv libsudo_util.so.0.0.0 /usr/lib/sudo/libsudo_util.so.0

  Command Explanations

   --libexecdir=/usr/lib: This switch controls where private programs are
   installed. Everything in that directory is a library, so they belong under
   /usr/lib instead of /usr/libexec.

   --with-secure-path: This switch transparently adds /sbin and /usr/sbin
   directories to the PATH environment variable.

   --with-all-insults: This switch includes all the sudo insult sets.

   --with-env-editor: This switch enables use of the environment variable
   EDITOR for visudo.

   --with-passprompt: This switch sets the password prompt.

   --without-pam: This switch avoids building Linux-PAM support when
   Linux-PAM is installed on the system.

  Note

   There are many options to sudo's configure command. Check the configure
   --help output for a complete list.

   ln -sfv libsudo_util...: Works around a bug in the installation process,
   which links to the previously installed version (if there is one) instead
   of the new one.

  Configuring Sudo

    Config File

   /etc/sudoers

    Configuration Information

   The sudoers file can be quite complicated. It is composed of two types of
   entries: aliases (basically variables) and user specifications (which
   specify who may run what). The installation installs a default
   configuration that has no privileges installed for any user.

   A couple of common configuration chanes are to set the path for the super
   user and to allow members of the wheel group to execute all commands after
   providing their own credientials. Use the following commands to create the
   /etc/sudoers.d/sudo configuration file as the root user:

 cat > /etc/sudoers.d/sudo << "EOF"
 Defaults secure_path="/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin"
 %wheel ALL=(ALL) ALL
 EOF

   For details, see man sudoers.

  Note

   The Sudo developers highly recommend using the visudo program to edit the
   sudoers file. This will provide basic sanity checking like syntax parsing
   and file permission to avoid some possible mistakes that could lead to a
   vulnerable configuration.

   If PAM is installed on the system, Sudo is built with PAM support. In that
   case, issue the following command as the root user to create the PAM
   configuration file:

 cat > /etc/pam.d/sudo << "EOF"
 # Begin /etc/pam.d/sudo

 # include the default auth settings
 auth      include     system-auth

 # include the default account settings
 account   include     system-account

 # Set default environment variables for the service user
 session   required    pam_env.so

 # include system session defaults
 session   include     system-session

 # End /etc/pam.d/sudo
 EOF
 chmod 644 /etc/pam.d/sudo

  Contents

   Installed Programs: sudo, sudoedit (symlink), sudoreplay, and visudo
   Installed Libraries: group_file.so, libsudo_util.so, sudoers.so,

   Installed Directories: /etc/sudoers.d, /usr/lib/sudo,
   /usr/share/doc/sudo-1.8.27, and /var/{lib,run}/sudo

    Short Descriptions

   sudo       executes a command as another user as permitted by the          
              /etc/sudoers configuration file.                                
   sudoedit   is a symlink to sudo that implies the -e option to invoke an    
              editor as another user.                                         
   sudoreplay is used to play back or list the output logs created by sudo.   
   visudo     allows for safer editing of the sudoers file.

Tripwire-2.4.3.7

  Introduction to Tripwire

   The Tripwire package contains programs used to verify the integrity of the
   files on a given system.

    Tripwire Dependencies

      Optional

   An MTA

   User Notes: http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/tripwire

  Installation of Tripwire

   Compile Tripwire by running the following commands:

 sed -e '/^CLOBBER/s/false/true/'         \
     -e 's|TWDB="${prefix}|TWDB="/var|'   \
     -e '/TWMAN/ s|${prefix}|/usr/share|' \
     -e '/TWDOCS/s|${prefix}/doc/tripwire|/usr/share/doc/tripwire-2.4.3.7|' \
     -i installer/install.cfg                               &&

 find . -name Makefile.am | xargs                           \
     sed -i 's/^[[:alpha:]_]*_HEADERS.*=/noinst_HEADERS =/' &&

 sed '/dist/d' -i man/man?/Makefile.am                      &&
 autoreconf -fi                                             &&

 ./configure --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc/tripwire       &&
 make

  Note

   The default configuration is to use a local MTA. If you don't have an MTA
   installed and have no wish to install one, modify install/install.cfg to
   use an SMTP server instead. Otherwise the install will fail.

   This package does not come with a test suite.

   Now, as the root user:

 make install &&
 cp -v policy/*.txt /usr/share/doc/tripwire-2.4.3.7

  Note

   During make install, several questions are asked, including passwords. If
   you want to make a script, you have to apply a sed before running make
   install:

 sed -i -e 's@installer/install.sh@& -n -s <site-password> -l <local-password>@' Makefile

   Of course, you should do this with dummy passwords and change them later.

   Another issue when scripting is that the installer exits when the standard
   input is not a terminal. You may disable this behavior with the following
   sed:

 sed '/-t 0/,+3d' -i installer/install.sh

  Command Explanations

   sed ... installer/install.cfg: This command tells the package to install
   the program database and reports in /var/lib/tripwire and sets the proper
   location for man pages and documentation.

   find ..., sed ..., and autoreconf -fi: The build system is unusable as is,
   and has to be modified for the build to succeed.

   make install: This command creates the Tripwire security keys as well as
   installing the binaries. There are two keys: a site key and a local key
   which are stored in /etc/tripwire/.

   cp -v policy/*.txt /usr/doc/tripwire-2.4.3.7: This command installs the
   tripwire sample policy files with the other tripwire documentation.i

  Configuring Tripwire

    Config Files

   /etc/tripwire/*

    Configuration Information

   Tripwire uses a policy file to determine which files are integrity
   checked. The default policy file (/etc/tripwire/twpol.txt) is for a
   default installation and will need to be updated for your system.

   Policy files should be tailored to each individual distribution and/or
   installation. Some example policy files can be found in
   /usr/share/doc/tripwire/.

   If desired, copy the policy file you'd like to try into /etc/tripwire/
   instead of using the default policy file, twpol.txt. It is, however,
   recommended that you edit your policy file. Get ideas from the examples
   above and read /usr/share/doc/tripwire/policyguide.txt for additional
   information. twpol.txt is a good policy file for learning about Tripwire
   as it will note any changes to the file system and can even be used as an
   annoying way of keeping track of changes for uninstallation of software.

   After your policy file has been edited to your satisfaction you may begin
   the configuration steps (perform as the root) user:

 twadmin --create-polfile --site-keyfile /etc/tripwire/site.key \
     /etc/tripwire/twpol.txt &&
 tripwire --init

   Depending on your system and the contents of the policy file, the
   initialization phase above can take a relatively long time.

    Usage Information

   Tripwire will identify file changes in the critical system files specified
   in the policy file. Using Tripwire while making frequent changes to these
   directories will flag all these changes. It is most useful after a system
   has reached a configuration that the user considers stable.

   To use Tripwire after creating a policy file to run a report, use the
   following command:

 tripwire --check > /etc/tripwire/report.txt

   View the output to check the integrity of your files. An automatic
   integrity report can be produced by using a cron facility to schedule the
   runs.

   Reports are stored in binary and, if desired, encrypted. View reports, as
   the root user, with:

 twprint --print-report -r /var/lib/tripwire/report/<report-name.twr>

   After you run an integrity check, you should examine the report (or email)
   and then modify the Tripwire database to reflect the changed files on your
   system. This is so that Tripwire will not continually notify you that
   files you intentionally changed are a security violation. To do this you
   must first ls -l /var/lib/tripwire/report/ and note the name of the newest
   file which starts with your system name as presented by the command uname
   -n and ends in .twr. These files were created during report creation and
   the most current one is needed to update the Tripwire database of your
   system. As the root user, type in the following command making the
   appropriate report name:

 tripwire --update --twrfile /var/lib/tripwire/report/<report-name.twr>

   You will be placed into Vim with a copy of the report in front of you. If
   all the changes were good, then just type :wq and after entering your
   local key, the database will be updated. If there are files which you
   still want to be warned about, remove the 'x' before the filename in the
   report and type :wq.

    Changing the Policy File

   If you are unhappy with your policy file and would like to modify it or
   use a new one, modify the policy file and then execute the following
   commands as the root user:

 twadmin --create-polfile /etc/tripwire/twpol.txt &&
 tripwire --init

  Contents

   Installed Programs: siggen, tripwire, twadmin, and twprint
   Installed Libraries: None
   Installed Directories: /etc/tripwire, /var/lib/tripwire, and

    Short Descriptions

   siggen   is a signature gathering utility that displays the hash function  
            values for the specified files.                                   
   tripwire is the main file integrity checking program.                      
   twadmin  administrative and utility tool used to perform certain           
            administrative functions related to Tripwire files and            
            configuration options.

Chapter 5. File Systems and Disk Management

   Journaling file systems reduce the time needed to recover a file system
   that was not unmounted properly. While this can be extremely important in
   reducing downtime for servers, it has also become popular for desktop
   environments. This chapter contains other journaling file systems you can
   use instead of the default LFS extended file system (ext2/3/4). It also
   provides introductory material on managing disk arrays.

About initramfs

   The only purpose of an initramfs is to mount the root filesystem. The
   initramfs is a complete set of directories that you would find on a normal
   root filesystem. It is bundled into a single cpio archive and compressed
   with one of several compression algorithms.

   At boot time, the boot loader loads the kernel and the initramfs image
   into memory and starts the kernel. The kernel checks for the presence of
   the initramfs and, if found, mounts it as / and runs /init. The init
   program is typically a shell script. Note that the boot process takes
   longer, possibly significantly longer, if an initramfs is used.

   For most distributions, kernel modules are the biggest reason to have an
   initramfs. In a general distribution, there are many unknowns such as file
   system types and disk layouts. In a way, this is the opposite of LFS where
   the system capabilities and layout are known and a custom kernel is
   normally built. In this situation, an initramfs is rarely needed.

   There are only four primary reasons to have an initramfs in the LFS
   environment: loading the rootfs from a network, loading it from an LVM
   logical volume, having an encrypted rootfs where a password is required,
   or for the convenience of specifying the rootfs as a LABEL or UUID.
   Anything else usually means that the kernel was not configured properly.

  Building an initramfs

   If you do decide to build an initramfs, the following scripts will provide
   a basis to do it. The scripts will allow specifying a rootfs via partition
   UUID or partition LABEL or a rootfs on an LVM logical volume. They do not
   support an encrypted root file system or mounting the rootfs over a
   network card. For a more complete capability see the LFS Hints or dracut.

   To install these scripts, run the following commands as the root user:

 cat > /sbin/mkinitramfs << "EOF"
 #!/bin/bash
 # This file based in part on the mkinitramfs script for the LFS LiveCD
 # written by Alexander E. Patrakov and Jeremy Huntwork.

  Using an initramfs

    Required Runtime Dependency

   cpio-2.12

   User Notes: http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/initramfs

   To build an initramfs, run the following as the root user:

 mkinitramfs [KERNEL VERSION]

   The optional argument is the directory where the appropriate kernel
   modules are located. This must be a subdirectory of /lib/modules. If no
   modules are specified, then the initramfs is named initrd.img-no-kmods. If
   a kernel version is specified, the initrd is named
   initrd.img-$KERNEL_VERSION and is only appropriate for the specific kernel
   specified. The output file will be placed in the current directory.

   After generating the initrd, copy it to the /boot directory.

   Now edit /boot/grub/grub.cfg and add a new menuentry. Below are several
   examples.

 # Generic initramfs and root fs identified by UUID
 menuentry "LFS Dev (LFS-7.0-Feb14) initrd, Linux 3.0.4"
 {
   linux  /vmlinuz-3.0.4-lfs-20120214 root=UUID=54b934a9-302d-415e-ac11-4988408eb0a8 ro
   initrd /initrd.img-no-kmods
 }

 # Generic initramfs and root fs on LVM partition
 menuentry "LFS Dev (LFS-7.0-Feb18) initrd lvm, Linux 3.0.4"
 {
   linux  /vmlinuz-3.0.4-lfs-20120218 root=/dev/mapper/myroot ro
   initrd /initrd.img-no-kmods
 }

 # Specific initramfs and root fs identified by LABEL
 menuentry "LFS Dev (LFS-7.1-Feb20) initrd label, Linux 3.2.6"
 {
   linux  /vmlinuz-3.2.6-lfs71-120220 root=LABEL=lfs71 ro
   initrd /initrd.img-3.2.6-lfs71-120220
 }

   Finally, reboot the system and select the desired system.

btrfs-progs-5.2.1

  Introduction to btrfs-progs

   The btrfs-progs package contains administration and debugging tools for
   the B-tree file system (btrfs).

   This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS-9.0
   platform.

    Package Information

     * Download (HTTP):
       https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/kdave/btrfs-progs/btrfs-progs-v5.2.1.tar.xz

     * Download MD5 sum: 9bacd0fec4efd449a6223f1c72ab91b3

     * Download size: 2.0 MB

     * Estimated disk space required: 55 MB (add 29 MB for tests)

     * Estimated build time: 0.2 SBU (add 13 SBU for tests)

    Btrfs-progs Dependencies

      Required

   LZO-2.10

      Recommended

   asciidoc-8.6.9 and xmlto-0.0.28 (both required to generate man pages)

      Optional

   LVM2-2.03.05 (dmsetup is used in tests), Python-2.7.16 (python bindings),
   reiserfsprogs-3.6.27 (for tests), and zstd (for tests)

   User Notes: http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/xfs

  Kernel Configuration

   Enable the following option in the kernel configuration and recompile the
   kernel:

 File systems --->
   <*/M> Btrfs filesystem support [CONFIG_BTRFS_FS]

  Note

   CONFIG_BTRFS_FS_POSIX_ACL and CONFIG_REISERFS_FS_XATTR are required for
   some tests. Other Btrfs options in the kernel are optional.

  Installation of btrfs-progs

   Install btrfs-progs by running the following commands:

 ./configure --prefix=/usr  \
             --bindir=/bin  \
             --libdir=/lib  \
             --disable-zstd &&
 make

  Note

   Some tests require grep built with perl regular expressions. To obtain
   this, rebuild grep with the LFS Chapter 6 instructions after installing
   PCRE-8.43.

   Before running tests, build a support program and disable several that
   fail:

 make fssum &&

 sed -i '/found/s/^/: #/' tests/convert-tests.sh &&

 mv tests/convert-tests/010-reiserfs-basic/test.sh{,.broken}                 &&
 mv tests/convert-tests/011-reiserfs-delete-all-rollback/test.sh{,.broken}   &&
 mv tests/convert-tests/012-reiserfs-large-hole-extent/test.sh{,.broken}     &&
 mv tests/convert-tests/013-reiserfs-common-inode-flags/test.sh{,.broken}    &&
 mv tests/convert-tests/014-reiserfs-tail-handling/test.sh{,.broken}         &&
 mv tests/misc-tests/025-zstd-compression/test.sh{,.broken}

   To test the results, issue (as the root user):

 pushd tests
    ./fsck-tests.sh
    ./mkfs-tests.sh
    ./cli-tests.sh
    ./convert-tests.sh
    ./misc-tests.sh
    ./fuzz-tests.sh
 popd

   Install the package as the root user:

 make install &&

 ln -sfv ../../lib/$(readlink /lib/libbtrfs.so) /usr/lib/libbtrfs.so &&
 ln -sfv ../../lib/$(readlink /lib/libbtrfsutil.so) /usr/lib/libbtrfsutil.so &&
 rm -fv /lib/libbtrfs.{a,so} /lib/libbtrfsutil.{a,so} &&
 mv -v /bin/{mkfs,fsck}.btrfs /sbin

  Command Explanations

   --disable-documentation: This option is needed if the recommended
   dependencies are not installed.

   mv tests/{cli,convert,misc,fuzz}-tests/ ...: Disables tests that fail and
   prevent tests from completing.

   ln -s ... /usr/lib/libbtrfs.so: Creates a symbolic link in the directory
   where it is expected.

   rm /lib/libbtrfs.{a,so}: Removes unneeded library entries.

  Contents

   Installed Programs: btrfs, btrfs-convert, btrfs-find-root, btrfs-image,
   btrfs-map-logical, btrfs-select-super, btrfsck (link to btrfs), btrfstune,
   fsck.btrfs, and mkfs.btrfs
   Installed Libraries: libbtrfs.so and libbtrfsutil.so
   Installed Directories: /usr/include/btrfs

    Short Descriptions

   btrfs              is the main interface into btrfs filesystem operations. 
   btrfs-convert      converts from an ext2/3/4 filesystem to btrfs.          
   btrfs-find-root    is a filter to find btrfs root.                         
   btrfs-map-logical  maps btrfs logical extent to physical extent.           
   btrfs-select-super overwrites the primary superblock with a backup copy.   
   btrfstune          tunes various filesystem parameters.                    
   fsck.btrfs         does nothing, but is present for consistency with       
                      fstab.                                                  
   mkfs.btrfs         creates a btrfs file system.

   make DESTDIR=$PWD/Dest install: This command installs the files to a
   temporary directory, so that the needed files can be installed.

   and thin-provisioning-tools

   User Notes: http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/lvm2

  Kernel Configuration

   Enable the following options in the kernel configuration and recompile the
   kernel:

  Note

   There are several other Device Mapper options in the kernel beyond those
   listed below. In order to get reasonable results if running the regression
   tests, all must be enabled either internally or as a module. The tests
   will all time out if Magic SysRq key is not enabled.

 Device Drivers --->
   [*] Multiple devices driver support (RAID and LVM) ---> [CONFIG_MD]
     <*/M>   Device mapper support                         [CONFIG_BLK_DEV_DM]
     <*/M/ >   Crypt target support                        [CONFIG_DM_CRYPT]
     <*/M/ >   Snapshot target                             [CONFIG_DM_SNAPSHOT]
     <*/M/ >   Thin provisioning target                    [CONFIG_DM_THIN_PROVISIONING]
     <*/M/ >   Mirror target                               [CONFIG_DM_MIRROR]
 Kernel hacking --->
   [*] Magic SysRq key                                     [CONFIG_MAGIC_SYSRQ]

  Installation of LVM2

   Install LVM2 by running the following commands:

 SAVEPATH=$PATH                  &&
 PATH=$PATH:/sbin:/usr/sbin      &&
 ./configure --prefix=/usr       \
             --exec-prefix=      \
             --enable-cmdlib     \
             --enable-pkgconfig  \
             --enable-udev_sync  &&
 make                            &&
 PATH=$SAVEPATH                  &&
 unset SAVEPATH

   The tests use udev for logical volume synchronization, so the LVM udev
   rules and some utilities need to be installed before running the tests. If
   you are installing LVM2 for the first time, and do not want to install the
   full package before running the tests, the minimal set of utilities can be
   installed by running the following instructions as the root user:

 make -C tools install_tools_dynamic &&
 make -C udev  install                 &&
 make -C libdm install

   To test the results, issue, as the root user:

 make check_local

   Other targets are available and can be listed with make -C test help. The
   test timings are very dependent on the speed of the disk(s), and on the
   number of enabled kernel options.

   The tests do not implement the âexpected failâ possibility, and a small
   number of test failures is expected by upstream. More failures may happen
   because some kernel options are missing. For example, the lack of the
   dm-delay device mapper target may explain some failures. Some tests are
   flagged âwarnedâ if thin-provisioning-tools are not installed. A
   workaround is to add the following flags to configure:

      --with-thin-check=    \
      --with-thin-dump=     \
      --with-thin-repair=   \
      --with-thin-restore=  \
      --with-cache-check=   \
      --with-cache-dump=    \
      --with-cache-repair=  \
      --with-cache-restore= \

   Some tests may hang. They can be removed if necessary, for example: rm
   test/shell/lvconvert-raid-reshape.sh. The tests generate a lot of kernel
   messages, which may clutter your terminal. You can disable them by issuing
   dmesg -D before running the tests (do not forget to issue dmesg -E when
   tests are done).

  Note

   The checks create device nodes in the /tmp directory. The tests will fail
   if /tmp is mounted with the nodev option.

   Now, as the root user:

 make install

  Command Explanations

   PATH=$PATH:/sbin:/usr/sbin: The path must contain /sbin and /usr/sbin for
   proper system tool detection by the configure script. This instruction
   ensures that PATH is properly set even if you build as an unprivileged
   user.

   --enable-cmdlib: This switch enables building of the shared command
   library. It is required when building the event daemon.

   --enable-pkgconfig: This switch enables installation of pkg-config support
   files.

   --enable-udev_sync: This switch enables synchronisation with Udev
   processing.

   --enable-dmeventd: This switch enables building of the Device Mapper event
   daemon.

About Logical Volume Management (LVM)

   LVM manages disk drives. It allows multiple drives and partitions to be
   combined into larger volume groups, assists in making backups through a
   snapshot, and allows for dynamic volume resizing. It can also provide
   mirroring similar to a RAID 1 array.

   A complete discussion of LVM is beyond the scope of this introduction, but
   basic concepts are presented below.

   To run any of the commands presented here, the LVM2-2.03.05 package must
   be installed. All commands must be run as the root user.

   Management of disks with lvm is accomplished using the following concepts:

   physical volumes

           These are physical disks or partitions such as /dev/sda3 or
           /dev/sdb.

   volume groups

           These are named groups of physical volumes that can be manipulated
           by the administrator. The number of physical volumes that make up
           a volume group is arbitrary. Physical volumes can be dynamically
           added or removed from a volume group.

   logical volumes

           Volume groups may be subdivided into logical volumes. Each logical
           volume can then be individually formatted as if it were a regular
           Linux partition. Logical volumes may be dynamically resized by the
           administrator according to need.

   To give a concrete example, suppose that you have two 2 TB disks. Also
   suppose a really large amount of space is required for a very large
   database, mounted on /srv/mysql. This is what the initial set of
   partitions would look like:

 Partition  Use    Size      Partition Type
 /dev/sda1  /boot  100MB     83 (Linux)
 /dev/sda2  /       10GB     83 (Linux)
 /dev/sda3  swap     2GB     82 (Swap)
 /dev/sda4  LVM    remainder 8e (LVM)
 /dev/sdb1  swap     2GB     82 (Swap)
 /dev/sdb2  LVM    remainder 8e (LVM)

   First initialize the physical volumes:

 pvcreate /dev/sda4 /dev/sdb2

   Next create a volume group named lfs-lvm:

 vgcreate lfs-lvm /dev/sda4  /dev/sdb2

   The status of the volume group can be checked by running the command
   vgscan. Now create the logical volumes. Since there is about 3900 GB
   available, leave about 900 GB free for expansion. Note that the logical
   volume named mysql is larger than any physical disk.

 lvcreate --name mysql --size 2500G lfs-lvm
 lvcreate --name home  --size  500G lfs-lvm

   Finally the logical volumes can be formatted and mounted. In this example,
   the jfs file system (jfsutils-1.1.15) is used for demonstration purposes.

 mkfs -t ext4 /dev/lfs-lvm/home
 mkfs -t jfs  /dev/lfs-lvm/mysql
 mount /dev/lfs-lvm/home /home
 mkdir -p /srv/mysql
 mount /dev/lfs-lvm/mysql /srv/mysql

   The LFS boot scripts automatically make these file systems available to
   the system in the checkfs script. Edit the /etc/fstab file as required to
   automatically mount them.

   A LVM logical volume can host a root filesystem, but requires the use of
   an initramfs (initial RAM file system) and is not discussed here.

   For a more information about LVM, see the LVM HOWTO and the lvm man pages.

About RAID

   The storage technology known as RAID (Redundant Array of Independent
   Disks) combines multiple physical disks into a logical unit. The drives
   can generally be combined to provide data redundancy or to extend the size
   of logical units beyond the capability of the physical disks or both. The
   technology also allows for providing hardware maintenance without powering
   down the system.

   The types of RAID organization are described in the RAID Wiki.

   Note that while RAID provides protection against disk failures, it is not
   a substitute for backups. A file deleted is still deleted on all the disks
   of a RAID array. Modern backups are generally done via rsync-3.1.3.

   There are three major types of RAID implementation: Hardware RAID,
   BIOS-based RAID, and Software RAID.

  Hardware RAID

   Hardware based RAID provides capability through proprietary hardware and
   data layouts. The control and configuration is generally done via firmware
   in conjunction with executable programs made available by the device
   manufacturer. The capabilities are generally supplied via a PCI card,
   although there are some instances of RAID components integrated in to the
   motherboard. Hardware RAID may also be available in a stand-alone
   enclosure.

   One advantage of hardware-based RAID is that the drives are offered to the
   operating system as a logical drive and no operating system dependent
   configuration is needed.

   Disadvantages include difficulties in transferring drives from one system
   to another, updating firmware, or replacing failed RAID hardware.

  BIOS-based RAID

   Some computers offter a hardware-like RAID implementation in the system
   BIOS. Sometime this is referred to as 'fake' RAID as the capabilites are
   generally incorporated into firmware without any hardware acceleration.

   The advantages and disadvantages of BIOS-based RAID are generally the same
   as hardware RAID with the additional disadvantage that there is no
   hardware acceleration.

   In some cases, BIOS-based RAID firmware is enabled by default (e.g. some
   DELL systems). If software RAID is desired, this option must be explicitly
   disabled in the BIOS.

  Software RAID

   Software based RAID is the most flexible form of RAID. It is easy to
   install and update and provides full capability on all or part of any
   drives available to the system. In BLFS, the RAID software is found in
   mdadm-4.0.

   Configuring a RAID device is straight forward using mdadm. Generally
   devices are created in the /dev directory as /dev/mdx where x is an
   integer.

   The first step in creating a RAID array is to use partitioning software
   such as fdisk or parted-3.2 to define the partitions needed for the array.
   Usually, there will be one partition on each drive participating in the
   RAID array, but that is not strictly necessary. For this example, there
   will be four disk drives: /dev/sda, /dev/sdb, /dev/sdc, and /dev/sdd. They
   will be partitioned as follows:

 Partition Size     Type                Use
 sda1:     100 MB   fd Linux raid auto  /boot    (RAID 1) /dev/md0
 sda2:      10 GB   fd Linux raid auto  /        (RAID 1) /dev/md1
 sda3:       2 GB   83 Linux swap       swap
 sda4      300 GB   fd Linux raid auto  /home    (RAID 5) /dev/md2

 sdb1:     100 MB   fd Linux raid auto  /boot    (RAID 1) /dev/md0
 sdb2:      10 GB   fd Linux raid auto  /        (RAID 1) /dev/md1
 sdb3:       2 GB   83 Linux swap       swap
 sdb4      300 GB   fd Linux raid auto  /home    (RAID 5) /dev/md2

 sdc1:      12 GB   fd Linux raid auto  /usr/src (RAID 0) /dev/md3
 sdc2:     300 GB   fd Linux raid auto  /home    (RAID 5) /dev/md2

 sdd1:      12 GB   fd Linux raid auto  /usr/src (RAID 0) /dev/md3
 sdd2:     300 GB   fd Linux raid auto  /home    (RAID 5) /dev/md2

   Is this arrangement, a separate boot partition is created as the first
   small RAID array and a root filesystem as the secong RAID array, both
   mirrored. The third partition is a large (about 1TB) array for the /home
   directory. This provides an ability to stripe data across multiple
   devices, improving speed for botih reading and writing large files.
   Finally, a fourth array is created that concatenates two partitions into a
   larger device.

  Note

   All mdadm commands must be run as the root user.

   To create these RAID arrays the commands are:

 /sbin/mdadm -Cv /dev/md0 --level=1 --raid-devices=2 /dev/sda1 /dev/sdb1
 /sbin/mdadm -Cv /dev/md1 --level=1 --raid-devices=2 /dev/sda2 /dev/sdb2
 /sbin/mdadm -Cv /dev/md3 --level=0 --raid-devices=2 /dev/sdc1 /dev/sdd1
 /sbin/mdadm -Cv /dev/md2 --level=5 --raid-devices=4 \
         /dev/sda4 /dev/sdb4 /dev/sdc2 /dev/sdd2

   The devices created can be examined by device. For example, to see the
   details of /dev/md1, use /sbin/mdadm --detail /dev/md1:

         Version : 1.2
   Creation Time : Tue Feb  7 17:08:45 2012
      Raid Level : raid1
      Array Size : 10484664 (10.00 GiB 10.74 GB)
   Used Dev Size : 10484664 (10.00 GiB 10.74 GB)
    Raid Devices : 2
   Total Devices : 2
     Persistence : Superblock is persistent

     Update Time : Tue Feb  7 23:11:53 2012
           State : clean
  Active Devices : 2
 Working Devices : 2
  Failed Devices : 0
   Spare Devices : 0

            Name : core2-blfs:0  (local to host core2-blfs)
            UUID : fcb944a4:9054aeb2:d987d8fe:a89121f8
          Events : 17

     Number   Major   Minor   RaidDevice State
        0       8        1        0      active sync   /dev/sda1
        1       8       17        1      active sync   /dev/sdb1

   From this point, the partitions can be formated with the filesystem of
   choice (e.g. ext3, ext4, xfsprogs-5.2.1, reiserfsprogs-3.6.27, etc). The
   formatted partitions can then be mounted. The /etc/fstab file can use the
   devices created for mounting at boot time and the linux command line in
   /boot/grub/grub.cfg can specify root=/dev/md1.

  Note

   The swap devices should be specified in the /etc/fstab file as normal. The
   kernel normally stripes swap data across multiple swap files and should
   not be made part of a RAID array.

   For further options and management details of RAID devices, refer to man
   mdadm.

   Additional details for monitoring RAID arrays and dealing with problems
   can be found at the Linux RAID Wiki.

  Installation of mdadm

   Fix a build error introduced by GCC-7.1:

 sed 's@-Werror@@' -i Makefile

   Install mdadm by running the following commands:

 make

   If you wish to run the tests, ensure that your kernel supports RAID and
   that a version of mdadm is not already running. As many as 9 out of 124
   tests may fail.

   First fix the test script to avoid a bogus error message when tests fail
   and build the supporting programs:

 sed -i 's# if.* == "1"#& -a -e $targetdir/log#' test &&
 make test

   Run the tests as the root user:

 ./test --keep-going --logdir=test-logs --save-logs

   Now, as the root user:

 make install

  Command Explanations

   make everything: This optional target creates extra programs, particularly
   a statically-linked version of mdadm and also versions of mdassemble.
   These all need to be manually installed.

   --keep-going: Run the tests to the end, even if one or more tests fail.

   --logdir=test-logs: Defines the directory where test logs are saved.

   --save-logs: Instructs the test suite to save the logs.

   --tests=<test1,test2,...>: Optional comma separated list of tests to be
   executed (all tests, if this option is not passed).

    Short Descriptions

   mdadm      manages MD devices aka Linux Software RAID.

ntfs-3g-2017.3.23

  Introduction to Ntfs-3g

   The Ntfs-3g package contains a stable, read-write open source driver for
   NTFS partitions. NTFS partitions are used by most Microsoft operating
   systems. Ntfs-3g allows you to mount NTFS partitions in read-write mode
   from your Linux system. It uses the FUSE kernel module to be able to
   implement NTFS support in user space. The package also contains various
   utilities useful for manipulating NTFS partitions.

   This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS-9.0
   platform.

    Package Information

     * Download MD5 sum: d97474ae1954f772c6d2fa386a6f462c

     * Download size: 1.2 MB

     * Estimated disk space required: 20 MB

     * Estimated build time: 0.2 SBU

    Ntfs-3g Dependencies

      Optional

   fuse 2.x (this disables user mounts)

   User Notes: http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/ntfs-3g

  Kernel Configuration

   Enable the following options in the kernel configuration and recompile the
   kernel if necessary:

 File systems  --->
   <*/M> FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace) support [CONFIG_FUSE_FS]

  Installation of Ntfs-3g

   Install Ntfs-3g by running the following commands:

 ./configure --prefix=/usr        \
             --disable-static     \
             --with-fuse=internal &&
 make

   This package does not come with a test suite.

   Now, as the root user:

 make install &&
 ln -sv ../bin/ntfs-3g /sbin/mount.ntfs &&
 ln -sv ntfs-3g.8 /usr/share/man/man8/mount.ntfs.8

   If you want ordinary users to be able to mount NTFS partitions you'll need
   to set mount.ntfs with the root user ID. Note: it is probably unsafe to do
   this on a computer that needs to be secure (like a server). As the root
   user:

 chmod -v 4755 /bin/ntfs-3g

  Command Explanations

   --disable-static: This switch prevents installation of static versions of
   the libraries.

   --with-fuse=internal: This switch dynamically forces ntfs-3g to use an
   internal copy of the fuse-2.x library. This is required if you wish to
   allow users to mount NTFS partitions.

   --disable-ntfsprogs: Disables installation of various utilities used to
   manipulate NTFS partitions.

   ln -sv ../bin/ntfs-3g /sbin/mount.ntfs: Creating /sbin/mount.ntfs makes
   mount default to using Ntfs-3g to mount NTFS partitions.

   chmod -v 4755 /bin/ntfs-3g: Making mount.ntfs setuid root allows non root
   users to mount NTFS partitions.

  Using Ntfs-3g

   To mount a Windows partition at boot time, put a line like this in
   /etc/fstab:

 /dev/sda1 /mnt/windows auto defaults 0 0

   To allow users to mount a usb stick with an NTFS filesystem on it, put a
   line similar to this (change sdc1 to whatever a usb stick would be on your
   system) in /etc/fstab:

 /dev/sdc1 /mnt/usb auto user,noauto,umask=0,utf8 0 0

   In order for a user to be able to mount the usb stick, they will need to
   be able to write to /mnt/usb, so as the root user:

 chmod -v 777 /mnt/usb

   ntfs-3g          is an NTFS driver, which can create, remove, rename, move 
                    files, directories, hard links, and streams. It can also  
                    read and write files, including streams, sparse files and 
                    transparently compressed files. It can also handle        
                    special files like symbolic links, devices, and FIFOs;    
                    moreover it provides standard management of file          
                    ownership and permissions, including POSIX ACLs.          
   ntfs-3g.probe    tests if an NTFS volume is mountable read only or         
                    read-write, and exits with a status value accordingly.    
                    The volume can be a block device or image file.           
   ntfs-3g.secaudit audits NTFS Security Data.                                
   ntfs-3g.usermap  creates the file defining the mapping of Windows accounts 
                    to Linux logins for users who owns files which should be  
                    visible from both Windows and Linux.                      
   ntfscluster      identifies files in a specified region of an NTFS volume  
   ntfscp           copies a file to an NTFS volume.                          
   ntfsfix          fixes common errors and forces Windows to check an NTFS   
                    partition.                                                
   ntfsls           lists directory contents on an NTFS filesystem.           
   ntfscat          prints NTFS files and streams on the standard output.     
   ntfsclone        clones an NTFS filesystem.                                
   ntfscmp          compares two NTFS filesystems and tells the differences.  
   ntfsinfo         dumps a file's attributes.

  Installation of Sshfs

   Install Sshfs by running the following commands:

 mkdir build &&
 cd    build &&
          
 meson --prefix=/usr .. &&
 ninja

   This package does not come with a test suite.

   Now, as the root user:

 ninja install

  Using Sshfs

   To mount an ssh server you need to be able to log into the server. For
   example, to mount your remote home folder to the local ~/examplepath (the
   directory must exist and you must have permissions to write to it):

 sshfs example.com:/home/userid ~/examplepath

   When you've finished work and want to unmount it again:

 fusermount3 -u ~/example

   You can also mount an sshfs filesystem at boot by adding an entry similar
   to the following in the /etc/fstab file:

 userid@example.com:/path /media/path fuse.sshfs _netdev,IdentityFile=/home/userid/.ssh/id_rsa 0 0

   See man 1 sshfs and man 8 mount.fuse for all available mount options.

 make DEBUG=-DNDEBUG     \
      INSTALL_USER=root  \
      INSTALL_GROUP=root \
      LOCAL_CONFIGURE_OPTIONS="--enable-readline"

   This package does not come with a test suite.

   Now, as the root user:

 make PKG_DOC_DIR=/usr/share/doc/xfsprogs-5.2.1 install     &&
 make PKG_DOC_DIR=/usr/share/doc/xfsprogs-5.2.1 install-dev &&

 rm -rfv /usr/lib/libhandle.a                                &&
 rm -rfv /lib/libhandle.{a,la,so}                            &&

   overrides the default optimization settings.

  Contents

   Installed Programs: fsck.xfs, mkfs.xfs, xfs_admin, xfs_bmap, xfs_copy,
   xfs_db, xfs_estimate, xfs_freeze, xfs_fsr, xfs_growfs, xfs_info, xfs_io,
   xfs_logprint, xfs_mdrestore, xfs_metadump, xfs_mkfile, xfs_ncheck,
   xfs_quota, xfs_repair, xfs_rtcp, and xfs_spaceman
   Installed Libraries: libhandle.so
   Installed Directories: /usr/include/xfs and /usr/share/doc/xfsprogs-5.2.1

    Short Descriptions

   fsck.xfs      simply exits with a zero status, since XFS partitions are    
                 checked at mount time.                                       
   mkfs.xfs      constructs an XFS file system.                               
   xfs_admin     changes the parameters of an XFS file system.                
   xfs_bmap      prints block mapping for an XFS file.                        
   xfs_copy      copies the contents of an XFS file system to one or more     
                 targets in parallel.                                         
   xfs_estimate  for each directory argument, estimates the space that        
                 directory would take if it were copied to an XFS filesystem  
                 (does not cross mount points).                               
   xfs_db        is used to debug an XFS file system.                         
   xfs_freeze    suspends access to an XFS file system.                       
   xfs_fsr       applicable only to XFS filesystems, improves the             
                 organization of mounted filesystems, the reorganization      
                 algorithm operates on one file at a time, compacting or      
                 othewise improving the layout of the file extents            
                 (contiguous blocks of file data).                            
   xfs_growfs    expands an XFS file system.                                  
   xfs_info      is equivalent to invoking xfs_growfs, but specifying that no 
                 change to the file system is to be made.                     
   xfs_io        is a debugging tool like xfs_db, but is aimed at examining   
                 the regular file I/O path rather than the raw XFS volume     
                 itself.                                                      
   xfs_logprint  prints the log of an XFS file system.                        
   xfs_mdrestore restores an XFS metadump image to a filesystem image.        
   xfs_metadump  copies XFS filesystem metadata to a file.                    
   xfs_mkfile    creates an XFS file, padded with zeroes by default.          
   xfs_ncheck    generates pathnames from inode numbers for an XFS file       
                 system.                                                      
   xfs_quota     is a utility for reporting and editing various aspects of    
                 filesystem quota.                                            
   xfs_repair    repairs corrupt or damaged XFS file systems.                 
   xfs_rtcp      copies a file to the real-time partition on an XFS file      
                 system.                                                      
   xfs_spaceman  reports and controls free space usage in an XFS file system. 
   libhandle.so  contains XFS-specific functions that provide a way to        
                 perform certain filesystem operations without using a file   
                 descriptor to access filesystem objects.

Ed-1.15

  Introduction to Ed

   Ed is a line-oriented text editor. It is used to create, display, modify
   and otherwise manipulate text files, both interactively and via shell
   scripts. Ed isn't something which many people use. It's described here
   because it can be used by the patch program if you encounter an ed-based
   patch file. This happens rarely because diff-based patches are preferred
   these days.

   This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS-9.0
   platform.

Vim-8.1.1846

  Introduction to Vim

   The Vim package, which is an abbreviation for VI IMproved, contains a vi
   clone with extra features as compared to the original vi.

   The default LFS instructions install vim as a part of the base system. If
   you would prefer to link vim against X, you should recompile vim to enable
   GUI mode. There is no need for special instructions since X support is
   automatically detected.

   This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS-9.0
   platform.

    Package Information

     * Download (HTTP):
       http://github.com/vim/vim/archive/v8.1.1846/vim-8.1.1846.tar.gz

     * Download MD5 sum: 4f129a05254d93c739fcede843df87df

     * Download size: 14.0 MB

     * Estimated disk space required: 103 MB

     * Estimated build time: 0.3 SBU (Using parallelism=4; add 1.2 SBU for
       tests)

    Vim Dependencies

      Recommended

   X Window System and GTK+-2.24.32

      Optional

   GPM-1.20.7, Lua-5.3.5, Python-2.7.16, Ruby-2.6.4, and Tcl-8.6.9

   User Notes: http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/vim

  Installation of Vim

  Note

   If you recompile Vim to link against X and your X libraries are not on the
   root partition, you will no longer have an editor for use in emergencies.
   You may choose to install an additional editor, not link Vim against X, or
   move the current vim executable to the /bin directory under a different
   name such as vi.

   Install Vim by running the following commands:

 echo '#define SYS_VIMRC_FILE  "/etc/vimrc"' >>  src/feature.h &&
 echo '#define SYS_GVIMRC_FILE "/etc/gvimrc"' >> src/feature.h &&

 ./configure --prefix=/usr \
             --with-features=huge \
             --with-tlib=ncursesw &&
 make

   To test the results, issue: make test. The vim test suite outputs a lot of
   binary data to the screen, which can cause issues with the settings of the
   current terminal. This can be resolved by redirecting the output to a log
   file. Even if one of the tests fails to produce the file test.out in
   src/testdir, the remaining tests will still be executed. If all goes
   well,the log will report ALL DONE. Note: Some color tests expect to be
   executed under the xterm terminal emulator. Three tests are known to fail
   occasionally and can be ignored.

   Now, as the root user:

 make install

   By default, Vim's documentation is installed in /usr/share/vim. The
   following symlink allows the documentation to be accessed via
   /usr/share/doc/vim-8.1.1846, making it consistent with the location of
   documentation for other packages:

 ln -snfv ../vim/vim81/doc /usr/share/doc/vim-8.1.1846

   If you wish to update the runtime files, issue the following command
   (requires rsync-3.1.3):

 rsync -avzcP --exclude="/dos/" --exclude="/spell/" \
     ftp.nluug.nl::Vim/runtime/ ./runtime/

   To install the runtime files and regenerate the tags file, as the root
   user issue:

 make -C src installruntime &&
 vim -c ":helptags /usr/share/doc/vim-8.1.1846" -c ":q"

  Command Explanations

   --with-features=huge: This switch enables all the additional features
   available in Vim, including support for multibyte characters.

   --with-tlib=ncursesw: This switch forces Vim to link against the
   libncursesw library.

   --enable-gui=no: This will prevent compilation of the GUI. Vim will still
   link against X, so that some features such as the client-server model or
   the x11-selection (clipboard) are still available.

   --without-x: If you prefer not to link Vim against X, use this switch.

   --enable-perlinterp, --enable-pythoninterp, --enable-tclinterp,
   --enable-rubyinterp: These options include the Perl, Python, Tcl, or Ruby
   interpreters that allow using other application code in vim scripts.

  Configuring Vim

    Config Files

   /etc/vimrc and ~/.vimrc

    Desktop File

   If desired, create a menu entry for graphical vim, gvim.desktop, as the
   root user

 cat > /usr/share/applications/gvim.desktop << "EOF"
 [Desktop Entry]
 Name=GVim Text Editor
 Comment=Edit text files
 Comment[pt_BR]=Edite arquivos de texto
 TryExec=gvim
 Exec=gvim -f %F
 Terminal=false
 Type=Application
 Icon=gvim.png
 Categories=Utility;TextEditor;
 StartupNotify=true
 MimeType=text/plain;
 EOF

    Configuration Information

   Vim has an integrated spell checker which you can enable it if you issue
   the following in a vim window:

 :setlocal spell spelllang=ru

   This setting will enable spell checking for the Russian language for the
   current session.

   By default, Vim only installs spell files for the English language. If a
   spell file is not available for a language, then Vim will call the
   $VIMRUNTIME/plugin/spellfile.vim plugin and will try to obtain the *.spl
   and optionally *.sug from the vim ftp server, by using the
   $VIMRUNTIME/plugin/netrwPlugin.vim plugin.

   Alternatively you can manually download the *.spl and *.sug files from:
   ftp://ftp.vim.org/pub/vim/runtime/spell/ and save them to ~/.vim/spell or
   in /usr/share/vim/vim81/spell/.

   To find out what's new in Vim-8.1.1846 issue the following command:

 :help version-8.1.1846

Chapter 7. Shells

   We are all familiar with the Bourne Again SHell, but there are two other
   user interfaces that are considered useful modern shells â the Berkeley
   Unix C shell and the Korn shell. This chapter installs packages compatible
   with these additional shell types.

Dash-0.5.10.2

  Introduction to Dash

   Dash is a POSIX compliant shell. It can be installed as /bin/sh or as the
   default shell for either root or a second user with a userid of 0. It
   depends on fewer libraries than the Bash shell and is therefore less
   likely to be affected by an upgrade problem or disk failure. Dash is also
   useful for checking that a script is completely compatible with POSIX
   syntax.

   This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS-9.0
   platform.

   symlink as the root user:

  Note

   If you create the symbolic link from dash to sh, you will need to reset
   the link to bash to build LFS.

 ln -svf dash /bin/sh

  Command Explanations

   --bindir=/bin: This parameter places the dash binary into the root
   filesystem.

   --with-libedit: To compile Dash with libedit support.

Tcsh-6.21.00

  Introduction to Tcsh

   The Tcsh package contains âan enhanced but completely compatible version
   of the Berkeley Unix C shell (csh)â. This is useful as an alternative
   shell for those who prefer C syntax to that of the bash shell, and also
   because some programs require the C shell in order to perform installation
   tasks.

   This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS-9.0
   platform.

    Package Information

     * Download (HTTP): http://fossies.org/linux/misc/tcsh-6.21.00.tar.gz

     * Estimated build time: 0.2 SBU (with tests)

   User Notes: http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/tcsh

  Installation of Tcsh

   First, fix the package for tool chain changes:

 sed -i 's|SVID_SOURCE|DEFAULT_SOURCE|g' config/linux  &&
 sed -i 's|BSD_SOURCE|DEFAULT_SOURCE|g'  config/linux

   Install Tcsh by running the following commands:

 ./configure --prefix=/usr --bindir=/bin &&

 make &&
 sh ./tcsh.man2html

   To test the results, issue: make check.

   Now, as the root user:

 make install install.man &&

 ln -v -sf tcsh   /bin/csh &&
 ln -v -sf tcsh.1 /usr/share/man/man1/csh.1 &&

 install -v -m755 -d          /usr/share/doc/tcsh-6.21.00/html &&
 install -v -m644 tcsh.html/* /usr/share/doc/tcsh-6.21.00/html &&
 install -v -m644 FAQ         /usr/share/doc/tcsh-6.21.00

  Command Explanations

   --bindir=/bin: This installs the tcsh program in /bin instead of /usr/bin.

   sh ./tcsh.man2html: This creates HTML documentation from the formatted man
   page.

   ln -v -sf tcsh /bin/csh: The FHS states that if there is a C shell
   installed, there should be a symlink from /bin/csh to it. This creates
   that symlink.

  Configuring Tcsh

    Config Files

   There are numerous configuration files for the C shell. Examples of these
   are /etc/csh.cshrc, /etc/csh.login, /etc/csh.logout, ~/.tcshrc, ~/.cshrc,
   ~/.history, ~/.cshdirs, ~/.login, and ~/.logout. More information on these
   files can be found in the tcsh(1) man page.

    Configuration Information

   Update /etc/shells to include the C shell program names (as the root
   user):

 cat >> /etc/shells << "EOF"
 /bin/tcsh
 /bin/csh
 EOF

   The following ~/.cshrc provides two alternative colour prompts and
   coloured ls output. If you prefer a global modification, issue the command
   as the root user, replacing ~/.cshrc by /etc/csh.cshrc.

 cat > ~/.cshrc << "EOF"
 # Original at:
 # https://www.cs.umd.edu/~srhuang/teaching/code_snippets/prompt_color.tcsh.html

   Now, as the root user:

 make install                              &&
 make infodir=/usr/share/info install.info &&

 install -v -m755 -d                 /usr/share/doc/zsh-5.7.1/html &&
 install -v -m644 Doc/html/*         /usr/share/doc/zsh-5.7.1/html &&
 install -v -m644 Doc/zsh.{html,txt} /usr/share/doc/zsh-5.7.1

   If you downloaded the optional documentation, install it by issuing the
   following commands as the root user:

 make htmldir=/usr/share/doc/zsh-5.7.1/html install.html &&
 install -v -m644 Doc/zsh.dvi /usr/share/doc/zsh-5.7.1

   If you built the PDF format of the documentation, install it by issuing
   the following command as the root user:

 install -v -m644 Doc/zsh.pdf /usr/share/doc/zsh-5.7.1

  Command Explanations

   --sysconfdir=/etc/zsh and --enable-etcdir=/etc/zsh: These parameters are
   used so that all the zsh configuration files are consolidated into the
   /etc/zsh directory. Omit these parameters if you wish to retain historical
   compatibility by having all the files located in the /etc directory.

   --bindir=/bin: This parameter places the zsh binaries into the root
   filesystem.

   --enable-cap: This option enables POSIX capabilities.

   --disable-gdbm: This option disables the use of the GDBM library.

   --enable-pcre: This option allows zsh to use the PCRE regular expression
   library in shell builtins.

    Multiple partitions

   Linking zsh dynamically against pcre and/or gdbm produces runtime
   dependencies on libpcre.so and/or libgdbm.so respectively, which both
   reside in /usr hierarchy. If /usr is a separate mount point and zsh needs
   to be available in boot time, then its supporting libraries should be in
   /lib too. You can move the libraries as follows:

 mv -v /usr/lib/libpcre.so.* /lib &&
 ln -v -sf ../../lib/libpcre.so.0 /usr/lib/libpcre.so

 mv -v /usr/lib/libgdbm.so.* /lib &&
 ln -v -sf ../../lib/libgdbm.so.3 /usr/lib/libgdbm.so

   Alternatively you can statically link zsh against pcre and gdbm if you
   modify the config.modules file (you need first to run configure to
   generate it).

  Configuring zsh

    Config Files

   There are a whole host of configuration files for zsh including
   /etc/zsh/zshenv, /etc/zsh/zprofile, /etc/zsh/zshrc, /etc/zsh/zlogin and
   /etc/zsh/zlogout. You can find more information on these in the zsh(1) and
   related manual pages.

   The first time zsh is executed, you will be prompted by messages asking
   several questions. The answers will be used to create a ~/.zshrc file. If
   you wish to run these questions again, run zsh
   /usr/share/zsh/5.7.1/functions/zsh-newuser-install -f.

   There are several built-in advanced prompts. In the zsh shell, start
   advanced prompt support with autoload -U promptinit, then promptinit.
   Available prompt names are listed with prompt -l. Select a particular one
   with prompt <prompt-name>. Display all available prompts with prompt -p.
   Except for the list and display commands above, you can insert the other
   ones in ~/.zshrc to be automatically executed at shell start, with the
   prompt you chose.

    Configuration Information

   Update /etc/shells to include the zsh shell program names (as the root
   user):

 cat >> /etc/shells << "EOF"
 /bin/zsh

Chapter 8. Virtualization

   Virtualization allows running a complete operating system, or virtual
   machine (VM), within another operating environment as a task. There are
   several commercial and open source environments that either emulate
   another processor or utilize the hardware virtualization features of the
   host processor.

qemu-4.1.0

  Introduction to qemu

   qemu is a full virtualization solution for Linux on x86 hardware
   containing virtualization extensions (Intel VT or AMD-V).

   This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS-9.0
   platform.

  Note

   This optional dependencies list is not comprehensive. See the output of
   ./configure --help for a more complete list.

   User Notes: http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/qemu

  KVM Prerequisites

   Before building qemu, check to see if your processor supports
   Virtualization Technology (VT):

 egrep '^flags.*(vmx|svm)' /proc/cpuinfo

   If you get any output, you have VT technology (vmx for Intel processors
   and svm for AMD processors). You then need to go into your system BIOS and
   ensure it is enabled. After enabing, reboot back to your LFS instance.

  Kernel Configuration

   Enable the following options in the kernel configuration and recompile the
   kernel if necessary:

 [*] Virtualization:  --->                            [CONFIG_VIRTUALIZATION]
   <*/M>   Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) support [CONFIG_KVM]
   <*/M>     KVM for Intel processors support         [CONFIG_KVM_INTEL]
   <*/M>     KVM for AMD processors support           [CONFIG_KVM_AMD]

   The Intel or AMD settings are not both required, but the one matching your
   system processor is required.

   To use the âbridgeâ network device, as explained below, check that
   bridge-utils-1.6 is installed and the following options in the kernel
   configuration are enabled:

 [*] Networking support  --->                         [CONFIG_NET]
   Networking options  --->
     <*/M> 802.1d Ethernet Bridging                   [CONFIG_BRIDGE]
 Device Drivers  --->
   [*] Network device support  --->                   [CONFIG_NETDEVICES]
     <*/M>    Universal TUN/TAP device driver support [CONFIG_TUN]

  Installation of qemu

   You will need a dedicated group that will contain users (other than root)
   allowed to access the KVM device. Create this group by running the
   following command as the root user:

 groupadd -g 61 kvm

   Add any users that might use the KVM device to that group:

 usermod -a -G kvm <username>

   Install qemu by running the following commands:

  Note

   Qemu is capable of running many targets. The build process is also capable
   of building multiple targets at one time in a comma delimited list
   assigned to --target-list. Run ./configure --help to get a complete list
   of available targets.

 if [ $(uname -m) = i686 ]; then
    QEMU_ARCH=i386-softmmu
 else
    QEMU_ARCH=x86_64-softmmu
 fi


 mkdir -vp build &&
 cd        build &&

 ../configure --prefix=/usr               \
              --sysconfdir=/etc           \
              --target-list=$QEMU_ARCH    \
              --python=python3            \
              --audio-drv-list=alsa       \
              --docdir=/usr/share/doc/qemu-4.1.0 &&

 unset QEMU_ARCH &&

 make

   To run the built in tests, run make V=1 -k check.

   Now, as the root user:

 make install

   You will also need to add an Udev rule so that the KVM device gets correct
   permissions:

 cat > /lib/udev/rules.d/65-kvm.rules << "EOF"
 KERNEL=="kvm", GROUP="kvm", MODE="0660"
 EOF

   Change the permissions and ownership of a helper script, which is needed
   when using the âbridgeâ network device (see below):

 chgrp kvm  /usr/libexec/qemu-bridge-helper &&
 chmod 4750 /usr/libexec/qemu-bridge-helper

  Note

   For convenience you may want to create a symbolic link to run the
   installed program. For instance:

 ln -sv qemu-system-`uname -m` /usr/bin/qemu

  Command Explanations

   --python=python3: This switch ensures that the build and test machinery
   uses Python 3.

   --audio-drv-list=alsa: This switch sets the audio driver to ALSA. See
   below for enabling other audio drivers.

   --audio-drv-list=pa: This switch sets the audio driver to pulseaudio. For
   other drivers see the --audio-drv-list list in configure's help output.
   The default audio driver is OSS. To enable support for both alsa and
   pulseaudio, use --audio-drv-list=alsa,pa.

   --with-gtkabi=3.0: builds with GTK+-3 if both GTK+-2 and GTK+-3 are
   installed.

  Using Qemu

   Since using qemu means using a virtual computer, the steps to set up the
   virtual machine are in close analogy with those to set up a real computer.
   You'll need to decide about CPU, memory, disk, USB devices, network
   card(s), screen size, etc. Once the âhardwareâ is decided, you'll have for
   example to choose how to connect the machine to internet, and/or to
   install an OS. In the following, we show basic ways of performing those
   steps. But qemu is much more than this, and it is strongly advised to read
   the qemu documentation in /usr/share/doc/qemu-4.1.0/qemu-doc.html.

  Note

   It is standard practice to name the computer running qemu âhostâ and the
   emulated machine running under qemu the âguestâ. We'll use those notations
   in the following.

  Note

   The following instructions assume the optional symbolic link, qemu, has
   been created. Additionally, qemu must be run from an X Window System based
   terminal (either locally or over ssh).

    Disk

   A virtual disk may be set up in the following way:

 VDISK_SIZE=50G
 VDISK_FILENAME=vdisk.img
 qemu-img create -f qcow2 $VDISK_FILENAME $VDISK_SIZE

   The virtual disk size and filename should be ajusted as desired. The
   actual size of the file will be less than specified, but will expand as
   needed, so it is safe to put a high value.

    Operating System

   To install an operating system, download an iso image from your preferred
   Linux distribution. For the purposes of this example, we'll use
   Fedora-16-x86_64-Live-LXDE.iso in the current directory. Run the
   following:

 qemu -enable-kvm                           \
      -drive file=$VDISK_FILENAME           \
      -cdrom Fedora-16-x86_64-Live-LXDE.iso \
      -boot d                               \
      -m 1G

   Follow the normal installation procedures for the chosen distribution. The
   -boot option specifies the boot order of drives as a string of drive
   letters. Valid drive letters are: a, b (floppy 1 and 2), c (first hard
   disk), d (first CD-ROM). The -m option is the amount of memory to use for
   the virtual machine. The choice depends on the load of the host. Modern
   distributions should be comfortable with 1GB. The -enable-kvm option
   allows hardware acceleration. Without this switch, the emulation is much
   slower.

    Defining the virtual hardware

   The virtual machine hardware is defined by the qemu command line. An
   example command is given below:

 qemu -enable-kvm                     \
      -smp 4                          \
      -cpu host                       \
      -m 1G                           \
      -drive file=$VDISK_FILENAME     \
      -cdrom grub-img.iso             \
      -boot order=c,once=d,menu=on    \
      -net nic,netdev=net0            \
      -netdev user,id=net0            \
      -soundhw ac97                   \
      -vga std                        \
      -serial mon:stdio               \
      -name "fedora-16"

    Meaning of the command line options

   -enable-kvm: enable full KVM virtualization support. On some hardware, it
   may be necessary to add the undocumented -machine smm=off option in order
   to enable KVM.

   -smp <N>: enable symmetric multiprocessing with <N> CPUs.

   -cpu <model>: simulate CPU <model>. the list of supported models can be
   obtained with -cpu help.

   -drive file=<filename>: defines a virtual disk whose image is stored in
   <filename>.

   -cdrom grub-img.iso: defines an iso formated file to use as a cdrom. Here
   we use a grub rescue disk, which may turn handy when something goes wrong
   at boot time.

   -boot order=c,once=d,menu=on: defines the boot order for the virtual BIOS.

   -net nic,netdev=<netid>: defines a network card connected to the network
   device with id <netid>.

   -netdev user,id=<netid>: defines the network âuserâ device. This is a
   virtual local network with addresses 10.0.2.0/24, where the host has
   address 10.0.2.2 and acts as a gateway to internet, and with a name server
   at address 10.0.2.3, and an smb server at address 10.0.2.4. A builtin DHCP
   server can allocate addresses between 10.0.2.15 and 10.0.2.31.

   -soundhw <model>: defines the soundcard model. The list may be obtained
   with -soundhw help.

   -vga <type>: defines the type of vga card to emulate.

   -serial mon:stdio: sends the serial port of the guest (/dev/ttyS0 on linux
   guests), multiplexed with the qemu monitor, to the standard input and
   output of the qemu process.

   -name <name>: sets the name of the guest. This name is displayed in the
   guest window caption. It may be useful if you run several guests at the
   same time.

    Controlling the Emulated Display

   It may happen that the guest window displayed by qemu does not correspond
   to the full capability of the emulated vga card. For example, the vmware
   card is 1600x900 capable, but only 1024x768 is displayed by default. A
   suitable Xorg configuration on the guest allows to use the full size (Note
   that the Xorg video driver to use is Xorg VMware Driver-13.3.0):

 cat > /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/20-vmware.conf << "EOF"
 Section         "Monitor"
   Identifier    "Monitor0"

   Option        "PreferredMode" "1600x900"
   HorizSync     1-200
   VertRefresh   1-200
 EndSection

 Section         "Device"
   Identifier    "VMware SVGA II Adapter"
   Option        "Monitor" "default"
   Driver        "vmware"
 EndSection

 Section         "Screen"
   Identifier    "Default Screen"
   Device        "VMware SVGA II Adapter"
   Monitor       "Monitor0"

   SubSection    "Display"

     Modes       "1600x900" "1440x900" "1366x768" "1280x720" "800x480"
   EndSubSection

 EndSection
 EOF

   New sizes will be available besides the native ones. You need to restart X
   in order to have the new sizes available.

    Networking

   The above solution for networking allows the guest to access the local
   network through the host (and possibly to access internet through the
   local routers), but the converse is not true. Not even the host can access
   the guest, unless port forwarding is enabled. And in the case several
   guests are running, they cannot communicate with each other. Other network
   devices can be used for this purpose. For example, there is the âsocketâ
   device, which allows several guests to share a common virtual network. In
   the following, we describe in more details how to set up the âbridgeâ
   device, which allows the guests to appear as if connected to the local
   network. All the commands below should be run as the root user.

   Set up bridging with bridge-utils-1.6. Only the physical interface(s)
   should be set up at boot. The virtual interface(s) will be added as needed
   when qemu is started.

   Set up a required configuration file:

 install -vdm 755 /etc/qemu &&
 echo allow br0 > /etc/qemu/bridge.conf

   In the command above, replace the switch -netdev user,... with -netdev
   bridge,id=net0.

                   Part III. General Libraries and Utilities

Chapter 9. General Libraries

   Libraries contain code which is often required by more than one program.
   This has the advantage that each program doesn't need to duplicate code
   (and risk introducing bugs), it just has to call functions from the
   libraries installed on the system. The most obvious example of a set of
   libraries is Glibc which is installed during the LFS book. This contains
   all of the C library functions which programs use.

   There are two types of libraries: static and shared. Shared libraries
   (usually libXXX.so) are loaded into memory from the shared copy at runtime
   (hence the name). Static libraries (libXXX.a ) are actually linked into
   the program executable file itself, thus making the program file larger.
   Quite often, you will find both static and shared copies of the same
   library on your system.

   Generally, you only need to install libraries when you are installing
   software that needs the functionality they supply. In the BLFS book, each
   package is presented with a list of (known) dependencies. Thus, you can
   figure out which libraries you need to have before installing that
   program. If you are installing something without using BLFS instructions,
   usually the README or INSTALL file will contain details of the program's
   requirements.

   There are certain libraries which nearly everyone will need at some point.
   In this chapter these and some others are listed and it is explained why
   you may want to install them.

Apr-1.7.0

  Introduction to Apr

   The Apache Portable Runtime (APR) is a supporting library for the Apache
   web server. It provides a set of application programming interfaces (APIs)
   that map to the underlying Operating System (OS). Where the OS doesn't
   support a particular function, APR will provide an emulation. Thus
   programmers can use the APR to make a program portable across different
   platforms.

   This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS-9.0
   platform.

   the libraries.

  Contents

   Installed Program: apr-1-config
   Installed Library: libapr-1.so
   Installed Directories: /usr/include/apr-1 and /usr/share/apr-1

    Short Descriptions

   optionally, ispell and spell.
   Installed Libraries: libaspell.so and libpspell.so
   Installed Directories: /usr/include/pspell and /usr/lib/aspell-0.60

    Short Descriptions

   aspell             is a utility that can function as an ispell -a          
                      replacement, as an independent spell checker, as a test 
                      utility to test out Aspell features, and as a utility   
                      for managing dictionaries.                              
   ispell             is a wrapper around aspell to invoke it in ispell       
                      compatible mode.                                        
   spell              is a wrapper around aspell to invoke it in spell        
                      compatible mode.                                        
   aspell-import      imports old personal dictionaries into Aspell.          
   precat             decompresses a prezipped file to stdout.                
   preunzip           decompresses a prezipped file.                          
   prezip             is a prefix delta compressor, used to compress sorted   
                      word lists or other similar text files.                 
   prezip-bin         is called by the various wrapper scripts to perform the 
                      actual compressing and decompressing.                   
   pspell-config      displays information about the libpspell installation,  
                      mostly for use in build scripts.                        
   run-with-aspell    is a script to help use Aspell as an ispell             
                      replacement.                                            
   word-list-compress compresses or decompresses sorted word lists for use    
                      with the Aspell spell checker.

Boost-1.70.0

  Introduction to Boost

   Boost provides a set of free peer-reviewed portable C++ source libraries.
   It includes libraries for linear algebra, pseudorandom number generation,
   multithreading, image processing, regular expressions and unit testing.

   This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS-9.0
   platform.

     * Download size: 93 MB

     * Estimated disk space required: 938 MB (168 MB installed)

     * Estimated build time: 1.8 SBU (Using parallelism=4; add 1.1 SBU for
       tests)

    Boost Dependencies

      Recommended

   Which-2.21

      Optional

   ICU-64.2, Python-2.7.16, and Open MPI

   User Notes: http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/boost

  Installation of Boost

   Install Boost by running the following commands:

 ./bootstrap.sh --prefix=/usr &&
 ./b2 stage threading=multi link=shared

   To run the Boost.Build's regression test, Python-2.7.16 is required. Run
   the tests with: issue pushd tools/build/test; python test_all.py; popd.
   All 152 tests should pass.

   To run every library's regression tests, issue pushd status; ../b2; popd.
   A few tests may fail. They take a very long time (over 119 SBU at -j4) and
   use a very large amount of disk space (46 GB). You should use the -jN
   switch to speed them up.

   Now, as the root user:

 ./b2 install threading=multi link=shared                 &&
 ln -svf detail/sha1.hpp /usr/include/boost/uuid/sha1.hpp

  Command Explanations

   threading=multi: This parameter ensures that Boost is built with
   multithreading support.

   link=shared: This parameter ensures that only shared libraries are
   created, except for libboost_exception and libboost_test_exec_monitor
   which are created as static. Most people will not need the static
   libraries, and most programs using Boost only use the headers. Omit this
   parameter if you do need static libraries.

   ln -svf detail/sha1.hpp ...: The uuid/sha1.hpp used to be a regular
   header, but by boost_1_66_0 it had been changed to load the similar
   detail/sha1.hpp header, with a message that it had been deprecated. It has
   now been removed, but not every package which uses it has been changed. An
   example is one of the libraries downloaded as a git version by
   libreoffice. The symlink enables this and similar packages to build.

   -jN: This switch may be added to the b2 command lines, to run up to N
   processes in parallel.

   --with-python=python3: Add this switch to the bootstrap command, if you
   want Boost to use Python3 instead of Python2. Using Python3 is known to
   cause the installation to fail on some systems.

  Installation of fftw

  Note

   We build fftw three times for different libraries in different numerical
   precisions: the default double precision floating point, the older 32-bit
   (single precision) version named float which sacrifices precision for
   speed, and the long double which offers increased precision at the cost of
   slower execution.

   The first build is for double precision arithmetic. Install fftw by
   running the following commands:

 ./configure --prefix=/usr    \
             --enable-shared  \
             --enable-threads \
             --enable-sse2    \
             --enable-avx     &&
 make

   To test the results, issue: make check. On 32-bit systems, the tests can
   take substantially longer than they would on 64-bit machines.

   Now, as the root user:

 make install

   Now build single precision:

 make clean &&

 ./configure --prefix=/usr    \
             --enable-shared  \
             --enable-threads \
             --enable-sse2    \
             --enable-avx     \
             --enable-float   &&
 make

   As the root user:

 make install

   Finally, build long double precision:

 make clean &&

 ./configure --prefix=/usr    \
             --enable-shared  \
             --enable-threads \
             --enable-long-double &&
 make

   As the root user:

 make install

  Command Explanations

   --enable-shared: Use shared libs instead of static libs.

   --enable-threads: This enables libfftw3_threads.so to be compiled. It is
   used by e.g. the gimp plugin from G'MIC.

   --enable-float: This enables building the library that uses single
   precision floating point arithmetic. It is faster but less precise than
   the default double precision library. The library will be called
   libfftw3f.so needed by PulseAudio-12.2.

   --enable-long-double: This enables building the library that uses higher
   precision long-double floating point arithmetic. The library will be
   called libfftw3l.so.

GLib-2.60.6

  Introduction to GLib

   The GLib package contains low-level libraries useful for providing data
   structure handling for C, portability wrappers and interfaces for such
   runtime functionality as an event loop, threads, dynamic loading and an
   object system.

   This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS-9.0
   platform.

    Package Information

     * Download (HTTP):
       http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/gnome/sources/glib/2.60/glib-2.60.6.tar.xz

     * Download (FTP):
       ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/gnome/sources/glib/2.60/glib-2.60.6.tar.xz

     * Download MD5 sum: cd6865d8ce40db5e4c12b7d180953de6

     * Download size: 4.4 MB

     * Estimated disk space required: 164 MB (add 3 MB for tests)

     * Estimated build time: 0.5 SBU (add 0.6 SBU for tests; both using
       paralleism=4)

    Additional Downloads

     * Optional patch:
       http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/patches/blfs/9.0/glib-2.60.6-skip_warnings-1.patch

    GLib Dependencies

      Recommended

   libxslt-1.1.33 and PCRE-8.43 (built with Unicode properties)

      Optional

   dbus-1.12.16 and bindfs (both may be used in some tests), GDB-8.3 (for
   bindings), docbook-xml-4.5, docbook-xsl-1.79.2, and GTK-Doc-1.32 (to build
   API documentation)

      Additional Runtime Dependencies

   gobject-introspection-1.60.2 (should be installed before gtk+, atk, etc.)

   Quoted directly from the INSTALL file: âSome of the mimetype-related
   functionality in GIO requires the update-mime-database and
   update-desktop-database utilitiesâ, which are part of
   shared-mime-info-1.12 and desktop-file-utils-0.24, respectively. These two
   utilities are also needed for some tests.

   User Notes: http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/glib2

  Installation of GLib

   If desired, apply the optional patch. In many cases, applications that use
   this library, either directly or indirectly via other libraries such as
   GTK+-3.24.10, output numerous warnings when run from the command line.
   This patch enables the use of an environment variable, GLIB_LOG_LEVEL,
   that supresses unwanted messages. The value of the variable is a digit
   that corresponds to:

   1 Alert    
   2 Critical 
   3 Error    
   4 Warning  
   5 Notice   

   For instance GLIB_LOG_LEVEL=4 will skip output of Warning and Notice
   messages (and Info/Debug messages if they are turned on). If
   GLIB_LOG_LEVEL is not defined, normal message output will not be affected.

 patch -Np1 -i ../glib-2.60.6-skip_warnings-1.patch

  Warning

   If upgrading from a previous version of GLib that was built using
   autotools, and the libtool archives (.la files) were installed, you will
   need to adjust all installed libtool archives,
   /usr/lib/libg{io,lib,module,object,thread}-2.0.la, to replace references
   to the libtool archives for this package with the appropriate linker
   library flag (-l), -lg{io,lib,module,object,thread}. 600+ files must be
   modified on a complete gnome desktop.

   Alternatively, you can just remove the unneeded .la files with the script
   at Libtool archive (.la) files.

   Install GLib by running the following commands:

 mkdir build &&
 cd    build &&

 meson --prefix=/usr      \
       -Dman=true         \
       -Dselinux=disabled \
       ..                 &&
 ninja

   The GLib test suite requires desktop-file-utils for some tests. However,
   desktop-file-utils requires GLib in order to compile; therefore, you must
   first install GLib and then run the test suite.

   Now, as the root user:

  Note

   If libxslt-1.1.33 is installed, the following command may indicate several
   (about 33) errors that start with "Error: no ID for constraint linkend:"
   when installing the man pages. These are harmless.

 ninja install &&

 mkdir -p /usr/share/doc/glib-2.60.6 &&
 cp -r ../docs/reference/{NEWS,gio,glib,gobject} /usr/share/doc/glib-2.60.6

   You should now install desktop-file-utils-0.24 and shared-mime-info-1.12
   and proceed to run the test suite.

   To test the results, after having installed the package, issue: ninja
   test. One test, gdatetime, is known to fail on sysvinit systems.

  Command Explanations

   -Dman=true: This switch causes the build to create and install the package
   man pages.

   -Dselinux=false: This switch disables support for selinux which is not
   supported in BLFS.

   -Ddoc=true: This switch causes the build to create and install the API
   documentation.

ICU-64.2

  Introduction to ICU

   The International Components for Unicode (ICU) package is a mature, widely
   used set of C/C++ libraries providing Unicode and Globalization support
   for software applications. ICU is widely portable and gives applications
   the same results on all platforms.

   This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS-9.0
   platform.

    Package Information

     * Download (HTTP):
       http://download.icu-project.org/files/icu4c/64.2/icu4c-64_2-src.tgz

     * Download MD5 sum: a3d18213beec454e3cdec9a3116d6b05

     * Download size: 23 MB

     * Estimated disk space required: 302 MB (add 35 MB for tests)

     * Estimated build time: 0.8 SBU (add 1.9 SBU for tests)

    ICU Dependencies

      Optional

   LLVM-8.0.1 (with Clang), and Doxygen-1.8.16 (for documentation)

   User Notes: http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/icu

  Installation of ICU

  Note

   If clang++ is available, it will be used in the mistaken belief that g++
   might not support C++11, even though configure has tested for that. If
   using g++ there will be an unnecessary warning at the end of configure.
   Building with g++ also takes longer than the estimated SBU shown.

   Install ICU by running the following commands:

 cd source                                    &&

 ./configure --prefix=/usr                    &&

  Installation of JS

  Caution

   If you are upgrading JS60 from a previously installed old version, save
   all work and exit your GNOME Session if you have one running. Replacing
   the JS60 binary will cause the GNOME Shell to crash and return you to your
   display manager or TTY. After installing the new version, reinstall
   Gjs-1.56.2. Polkit is unaffected.

   Install JS by running the following commands:

  Note

   If installing in the chroot environment, be sure to export the SHELL
   environment variable or configuration of the package will fail.

 mkdir mozjs-build &&
 cd    mozjs-build &&

 ../js/src/configure --prefix=/usr       \
                     --with-intl-api     \

 make

   This package does not come with a working test suite.

   Now, as the root user:

 make install

  Command Explanations

   --with-*: These parameters allow the build system to use system versions
   of the above libriares. These are required for stability.

   --enable-readline: This switch enables Readline support in the JS shell.

   --disable-jemalloc: This switch disables the internal memory allocator
   used in JS60. jemalloc causes a conflict with glibc.

  Installation of keyutils

   Install keyutils by running the following commands:

 make

   To test the results, issue, as the root user:

 sed -i '/find/s:/usr/bin/::' tests/Makefile &&
 make -k test

   Note that several tests will fail if certain uncommon kernel options were
   not used when the kernel was built. These include CONFIG_BIG_KEYS,
   CONFIG_KEY_DH_OPERATIONS, and CONFIG_CRYPTO_DH.

   Now, as the root user:

 make NO_ARLIB=1 install

  Command Explanations

   NO_ARLIB=1: This make flag disables installing the static library.

  Configuring keyutils

    Config Files

   /etc/request-key.conf and /etc/request-key.d/*

  Contents

   Installed Programs: keyctl, key.dns_resolver, and request-key
   Installed Library: libkeyutils.so
   Installed Directory: /etc/request-key.d and /usr/share/keyutils

    Short Descriptions

   keyctl           is to control the key management facility in various ways 
                    using a variety of subcommands.                           
   key.dns_resolver is invoked by request-key on behalf of the kernel when    
                    kernel services (such as NFS, CIFS and AFS) need to       
                    perform a hostname lookup and the kernel does not have    
                    the key cached. It is not ordinarily intended to be       
                    called directly.                                          
   request-key      is invoked by the kernel when the kernel is asked for a   
                    key that it doesn't have immediately available. The       
                    kernel creates a temporary key and then calls out to this 
                    program to instantiate it. It is not intended to be       
                    called directly.                                          
   libkeyutils.so   contains the keyutils library API instantiation.

libaio-0.3.112

  Introduction to libaio

   The libaio package is an asynchronous I/O facility ("async I/O", or "aio")
   that has a richer API and capability set than the simple POSIX async I/O
   facility. This library, libaio, provides the Linux-native API for async
   I/O. The POSIX async I/O facility requires this library in order to
   provide kernel-accelerated async I/O capabilities, as do applications
   which require the Linux-native async I/O API.

   This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS-9.0
   platform.

    libxml2 Dependencies

      Optional

   Python-2.7.16

  Note

   Some packages which utilize libxml2 (such as GNOME Doc Utils) need the
   Python3 module installed to function properly and some packages will not
   build properly if the Python3 module is not available.

   The old Python2 module can be built after libxml2.so has been installed,
   see libxml2-2.9.9 (for Python2).

      Optional

   ICU-64.2 and Valgrind-3.15.0 (may be used in the tests)

   User Notes: http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/libxml2

  Installation of libxml2

   Install libxml2 by running the following commands:

 ./configure --prefix=/usr    \
             --disable-static \
             --with-history   \
             --with-python=/usr/bin/python3 &&
 make

   If you downloaded the testsuite, issue the following command:

 tar xf ../xmlts20130923.tar.gz

   To test the results, issue: make check > check.log. A summary of the
   results can be obtained with grep -E '^Total|expected' check.log. If
   Valgrind-3.15.0 is installed and you want to check memory leaks, replace
   check with check-valgrind.

  Note

   The tests use http://localhost/ to test parsing of external entities. If
   the machine where you run the tests serves as a web site, the tests may
   hang, depending on the content of the file served. It is therefore
   recommended to shut down the server during the tests, as the root user:

 /etc/init.d/httpd stop

   Now, as the root user:

 make install

  Command Explanations

   --disable-static: This switch prevents installation of static versions of
   the libraries.

   --with-history: This switch enables Readline support when running
   xmlcatalog or xmllint in shell mode.

   --with-python=/usr/bin/python3: Allows building the libxml2 module with
   Python3 instead of Python2.

   --with-icu: Add this switch if you have built ICU-64.2, for better unicode
   support.

   --with-threads: Add this switch to enable multithread support.

  Contents

   Installed Programs: xml2-config, xmlcatalog, and xmllint

   /usr/share/gtk-doc/html/libxml2

    Short Descriptions

   xml2-config   determines the compile and linker flags that should be used  
                 to compile and link programs that use libxml2.               
   xmlcatalog    is used to monitor and manipulate XML and SGML catalogs.     
   xmllint       parses XML files and outputs reports (based upon options) to 
                 detect errors in XML coding.                                 
   libxml2.so    provides functions for programs to parse files that use the  
                 XML format.

NSPR-4.21

  Introduction to NSPR

   Netscape Portable Runtime (NSPR) provides a platform-neutral API for
   system level and libc like functions.

   This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS-9.0
   platform.

    Package Information

     * Download (HTTP):
       https://archive.mozilla.org/pub/nspr/releases/v4.21/src/nspr-4.21.tar.gz

     * Download size: 1.1 MB

     * Estimated disk space required: 10 MB

     * Estimated build time: less than 0.1 SBU

   User Notes: http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/nspr

  Installation of NSPR

   Install NSPR by running the following commands:

 cd nspr                                                     &&
 sed -ri 's#^(RELEASE_BINS =).*#\1#' pr/src/misc/Makefile.in &&
 sed -i 's#$(LIBRARY) ##'            config/rules.mk         &&

 ./configure --prefix=/usr \
             --with-mozilla \
             --with-pthreads \
             $([ $(uname -m) = x86_64 ] && echo --enable-64bit) &&
 make

   The testsuite is designed for testing changes to nss or nspr and is not
   particularly useful for checking a released version (e.g. it needs to be
   run on a non-optimized build with both nss and nspr directories existing
   alongside each other). For further details, see the User Notes for nss at
   http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/nss

   Now, as the root user:

 make install

  Command Explanations

   sed -ri 's#^(RELEASE_BINS =).*#\1#' pr/src/misc/Makefile.in: This sed
   disables installing two unneeded scripts.

   sed -i 's#$(LIBRARY) ##' config/rules.mk: This sed disables installing the
   static libraries.

   --with-mozilla: This parameter adds Mozilla support to the libraries
   (required if you want to build any other Mozilla products and link them to
   these libraries).

   --with-pthreads: This parameter forces use of the system pthread library.

   $([ $(uname -m) = x86_64 ] && echo --enable-64bit): The --enable-64bit
   parameter is required on an x86_64 system to prevent configure failing
   with a claim that this is a system without pthread support. The [ $(uname
   -m) = x86_64 ] test ensures it has no effect on a 32 bit system.

                                   /usr/share/doc/fontconfig-2.13.1

  Command Explanations

   --disable-docs: This switch avoids building the documentation (the release
   tarball includes pre-generated documentation).

  Configuring Fontconfig

    Config Files

   /etc/fonts/*, /etc/fonts/conf.d/* and /usr/share/fontconfig/conf.avail/*

    Configuration Information

   The main configuration file for Fontconfig is /etc/fonts/fonts.conf.
   Generally you do not want to edit this file. It will also read
   /etc/fonts/local.conf and any files in /etc/fonts/conf.d. To put a new
   font directory in the configuration, create (or update) the
   /etc/fonts/local.conf file with your local information or add a new file
   in /etc/fonts/conf.d. The default location of fonts in Fontconfig is:

     * /usr/share/fonts

     * ~/.local/share/fonts

     * ~/.fonts (this is now deprecated, but for the moment it still works)

   Fontconfig also ships many example configuration files in the
   /usr/share/fontconfig/conf.avail directory. Symlinking specific files to
   /etc/fonts/conf.d will enable them. The default setup is generally good
   enough for most users. See /etc/fonts/conf.d/README for a description of
   the configuration files.

   More information about configuring Fontconfig can be found in the user's
   manual in file:///usr/share/doc/fontconfig-2.13.1/fontconfig-user.html.

Graphite2-1.3.13

  Introduction to Graphite2

   Graphite2 is a rendering engine for graphite fonts. These are TrueType
   fonts with additional tables containing smart rendering information and
   were originally developed to support complex non-Roman writing systems.
   They may contain rules for e.g. ligatures, glyph substitution, kerning,
   justification - this can make them useful even on text written in Roman
   writing systems such as English. Note that firefox by default provides an
   internal copy of the graphite engine and cannot use a system version
   (although it can now be patched to use it), but it too should benefit from
   the availability of graphite fonts.

   This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS-9.0
   platform.

      Optional

   FreeType-2.10.1, Python-2.7.16, and silgraphite to build the comparerender
   test and benchmarking tool, and if that is present, HarfBuzz-2.6.0 to add
   more functionality to it (this is a circular dependency, you would need to
   first build graphite2 without harfbuzz).

   To build the documentation: asciidoc-8.6.9, Doxygen-1.8.16,
   texlive-20190410 (or install-tl-unx), and dblatex (for PDF docs)

   To execute the test suite you will need FontTools (Python 3 module),
   otherwise, the "cmp" tests fail.

      Optional (at runtime)

   You will need at least one suitable graphite font for the package to be
   useful.

   User Notes: http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/graphite2

  Installation of Graphite2

   Some tests fail if FontTools (Python 3 module) is not installed. These
   tests can be removed with:

 sed -i '/cmptest/d' tests/CMakeLists.txt

  Installation of Poppler

   Install Poppler by running the following commands:

 mkdir build                         &&
 cd    build                         &&

 cmake  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release   \
        -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr  \
        -DTESTDATADIR=$PWD/testfiles \
        -DENABLE_UNSTABLE_API_ABI_HEADERS=ON     \
        ..                           &&
 make

   In order to run the test suite, some testcases are needed and can be
   obtained only from a git repository. The command to download them is: git
   clone git://git.freedesktop.org/git/poppler/test testfiles. Then issue:
   LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 make test. Only the Qt5 libraries are tested.

   Now, as the root user:

 make install

   To install the documentation, run the following commands as root:

 install -v -m755 -d           /usr/share/doc/poppler-0.79.0 &&
 cp -vr ../glib/reference/html /usr/share/doc/poppler-0.79.0

    Poppler Data

   If you downloaded the additional encoding data package, install it by
   issuing the following commands:

 tar -xf ../../poppler-data-0.4.9.tar.gz &&
 cd poppler-data-0.4.9

   Now, as the root user:

 make prefix=/usr install

  Command Explanations

   -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release: This switch is used to apply a higher level of
   compiler optimizations.

   -DTESTDATADIR=$PWD/testfiles: Tell the test programs where the auxiliary
   files are located.

   -DENABLE_UNSTABLE_API_ABI_HEADERS=ON: Install some old Xpdf headers
   required by certain programs (e.g. Inkscape).

   -DENABLE_GTK_DOC=ON: Use this parameter if GTK-Doc is installed and you
   wish to rebuild and install the API documentation. If Python 2 is not
   installed, one script needs to be changed: run sed -i '1s/python/&3/'
   make-glib-api-docs first.

   LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 make test: Run the test suite. The environment variable
   LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 is only needed if the default locale does not include
   UTF-8.

  Configuring Desktop File Utils

    Configuration Information

   The XDG Base Directory specification defines the standard locations for
   applications to place data and configuration files. These files can be
   used, for instance, to define the menu structure and menu items in a
   desktop environment.

   The default location for configuration files to be installed is /etc/xdg,
   and the default locations for data files are /usr/local/share and
   /usr/share. These locations can be extended with the environment variables
   XDG_CONFIG_DIRS and XDG_DATA_DIRS, respectively. The GNOME, KDE and XFCE
   environments respect these settings.

   When a package installs a .desktop file to a location in one of the base
   data directories, the database that maps MIME-types to available
   applications can be updated. For instance, the cache file at
   /usr/share/applications/mimeinfo.cache can be rebuilt by executing the
   following command as the root user:

 install -vdm755 /usr/share/applications &&

Graphviz-2.40.1

  Introduction to Graphviz

   The Graphviz package contains graph visualization software. Graph
   visualization is a way of representing structural information as diagrams
   of abstract graphs and networks. Graphviz has several main graph layout
   programs. It also has web and interactive graphical interfaces, auxiliary
   tools, libraries, and language bindings.

   This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS-9.0
   platform.

    Graphviz Dependencies

  Note

   Graphviz basic usage does not need any libraries out of what is found in
   the LFS book. Its âcoreâ rendering engine allows to generate several
   graphic formats, such as Postscript, SVG, VML, .fig, and Tk. Those formats
   can be converted to almost any other, using for example tools from
   ImageMagick-7.0.8-60. The dependencies below add the ability to generate
   graph images in bitmap format, to display the graph image on screen, to
   edit a graph by seeing directly the result image, or to view large graphs.
   Since Graphviz is a dependency of several other packages in this book, it
   is suggested to first build it without any dependencies, then to rebuild
   it when you have built enough packages to suit your needs.

      Optional, for various bitmap outputs

   Pango-1.42.4, with Cairo-1.16.0, Xorg Libraries, Fontconfig-2.13.1, and
   libpng-1.6.37, to generate images in bitmap SVG, postscript, PNG, and PDF
   formats, or displaying the image on screen

   Adding GTK+-2.24.32 with libjpeg-turbo-2.0.2 allows to add JPEG, BMP, TIF,
   and ICO formats, and to display the image in a GTK+ window

   GD Library may be used instead of Pango. It adds the ability to generate
   images in GIF, VRML, and GD formats, but Pango provides better outputs for
   the other formats, and is needed for displaying images

   Other formats may be added with libwebp-1.0.3 (WebP support is considered
   experimental), DevIL, libLASi, glitz, and libming (Macromedia Flash)

      Optional, to load graphic images that may be displayed inside the nodes of
      a graph

   libgs.so from ghostscript-9.27, librsvg-2.44.14, and Poppler-0.79.0

      Optional, to build more tools

   Freeglut-3.0.0 (with libglade-2.6.4, GtkGLExt, and libGTS, for building
   the smyrna large graph viewer, which is considered experimental),
   Qt-5.13.0, for building the gvedit graph editor. Another graph editor,
   dotty needs only Xorg Libraries

      Optional (To Build Language Bindings)

   SWIG-4.0.0 (SWIG must be installed or no bindings will be built),
   GCC-9.2.0 (for the go language), Guile-2.2.6, OpenJDK-12.0.2, Lua-5.3.5,
   PHP-7.3.8, Python-2.7.16, Ruby-2.6.4, Tcl-8.6.9, Tk-8.6.9, Io, Mono,
   OCaml, and R

      Optional (building tools)

   Criterion (framework for tests), Electric Fence,

   User Notes: http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/graphviz

  Installation of Graphviz

   If Ruby-2.6.4 is installed, and you want to build Ruby bindings, fix
   ruby's detection:

 sed -e '/ruby/s/1\.9/2.6/' -i configure.ac

   If Qt-5.13.0 is installed, and you want to build the gvedit graph editor,
   issue:

 patch -p1 -i ../graphviz-2.40.1-qt5-1.patch

   Install Graphviz by running the following commands:

 sed -i '/LIBPOSTFIX="64"/s/64//' configure.ac &&

 autoreconf                &&
 ./configure --prefix=/usr &&
 make

   This package does not come with a test suite that provides meaningful
   results.

   Now, as the root user:

 make install

   If desired, create a symbolic link in the system documents directory to
   the documentation installed in /usr/share/graphviz/doc using the following
   command as the root user:

 ln -v -s /usr/share/graphviz/doc \
          /usr/share/doc/graphviz-2.40.1

  Command Explanations

   sed ... configure.ac: This command is needed to avoid installing files in
   /usr/lib64.

   --with-javaincludedir="$JAVA_HOME/include -I$JAVA_HOME/include/linux": If
   you have built OpenJDK-12.0.2 in /opt, and you want to build the JAVA
   bindings, it is necessary to specify the location of the JAVA header files
   to configure. The configure switch is designed for only one directory, but
   two directories need to be included. This is possible nevertheless by
   using the -I switch inside the variable.

   --with-webp: Even if libwebp-1.0.3 is installed, it is not included in the
   build without this option.

   --with-smyrna: Even if the needed dependencies are installed, the
   interactive graph viewer smyrna is not built without this option.

  Configuring Graphviz

    Config Files

   /usr/lib/graphviz/config

    Configuration Information

   There are no specific configuration requirements for Graphviz. You may
   consider installing the additional plugins and tools available from the
   download page at http://www.graphviz.org/Download_source.php for
   additional capabilities. If additional plugins are installed, you can run
   dot -c (as the root user) to update the config file in /usr/lib/graphviz.

    Short Descriptions

   acyclic        is a filter that takes a directed graph as input and        
                  outputs a copy of the graph with sufficient edges reversed  
                  to make the graph acyclic.                                  
   bcomps         decomposes graphs into their biconnected components,        
                  printing the components to standard output.                 
   ccomps         decomposes graphs into their connected components, printing 
                  the components to standard output.                          
   circo          draws graphs using a circular layout.                       
   cluster        takes as input a graph in DOT format, finds node clusters   
                  and augments the graph with this information.               
   diffimg        (needs GD Library) generates an image where each pixel is   
                  the difference between the corresponding pixel in each of   
                  the two source images.                                      
   dijkstra       reads a stream of graphs and for each computes the distance 
                  of every node from sourcenode.                              
   dot            draws directed graphs. It works well on DAGs and other      
                  graphs that can be drawn as hierarchies. It reads           
                  attributed graph files and writes drawings. By default, the 
                  output format dot is the input file with layout coordinates 
                  appended.                                                   
   dot2gxl        converts between graphs represented in GXL and in the DOT   
                  language. Unless a conversion type is specified using a     
                  flag, gxl2dot will deduce the type of conversion from the   
                  suffix of the input file, a .dot suffix causing a           
                  conversion from DOT to GXL, and a .gxl suffix causing a     
                  conversion from GXL to DOT.                                 
   dotty          is a graph editor for the X Window System. It may be run as 
                  a standalone editor, or as a front end for applications     
                  that use graphs. It can control multiple windows viewing    
                  different graphs.                                           
   edgepaint      edge coloring to disambiguate crossing edges.               
   fdp            draws undirected graphs using a âspringâ model. It relies   
                  on a force-directed approach in the spirit of Fruchterman   
                  and Reingold.                                               
   gc             is a graph analogue to wc in that it prints to standard     
                  output the number of nodes, edges, connected components or  
                  clusters contained in the input files. It also prints a     
                  total count for all graphs if more than one graph is given. 
   gml2gv         converts a graph specified in the GML format to a graph in  
                  the GV (formerly DOT) format.                               
   graphml2gv     converts a graph specified in the GRAPHML format to a graph 
                  in the GV (formerly DOT) format.                            
   gv2gml         converts a graph specified in the GV format to a graph in   
                  the GML format.                                             
   gv2gxl         converts a graph specified in the GV format to a graph in   
                  the GXL format.                                             
   gvcolor        is a filter that sets node colors from initial seed values. 
                  Colors flow along edges from tail to head, and are averaged 
                  (as HSB vectors) at nodes.                                  
   gvedit         provides a simple graph editor and viewer. It allows many   
                  graphs to be viewed at the same time. The text of each      
                  graph is displayed in its own text window.                  
   gvgen          generates a variety of simple, regularly-structured         
                  abstract graphs.                                            
   gvmap          takes as input a graph in DOT format, finds node clusters   
                  and produces a rendering of the graph as a geographic-style 
                  map, with clusters highlighted, in xdot format.             
   gvmap.sh       is a pipeline for running gvmap.                            
   gvpack         reads in a stream of graphs, combines the graphs into a     
                  single layout, and produces a single graph serving as the   
                  union of the input graphs.                                  
   gvpr           is a graph stream editor inspired by awk. It copies input   
                  graphs to its output, possibly transforming their structure 
                  and attributes, creating new graphs, or printing arbitrary  
                  information.                                                
   gxl2dot        converts between graphs represented in GXL and in the DOT   
                  language. Unless a conversion type is specified using a     
                  flag, gxl2dot will deduce the type of conversion from the   
                  suffix of the input file, a .dot suffix causing a           
                  conversion from DOT to GXL, and a .gxl suffix causing a     
                  conversion from GXL to DOT.                                 
   gxl2gv         converts between graphs represented in GXL and in the GV    
                  language.                                                   
   lefty          is a two-view graphics editor for technical pictures.       
   lneato         is a graph editor for the X Window System. It may be run as 
                  a standalone editor, or as a front end for applications     
                  that use graphs. It can control multiple windows viewing    
                  different graphs.                                           
   mm2gv          converts a sparse matrix of the Matrix Market format to a   
                  graph in the GV (formerly DOT) format.                      
   neato          draws undirected graphs using âspringâ models. Input files  
                  must be formatted in the dot attributed graph language. By  
                  default, the output of neato is the input graph with layout 
                  coordinates appended.                                       
   nop            reads a stream of graphs and prints each in pretty-printed  
                  (canonical) format on stdout. If no files are given, it     
                  reads from stdin.                                           
   osage          draws clustered graphs. As input, it takes any graph in the 
                  DOT format.                                                 
   patchwork      draws clustered graphs using a squarified treemap layout.   
                  As input, it takes any graph in the DOT format.             
   prune          reads directed graphs in the same format used by dot and    
                  removes subgraphs rooted at nodes specified on the command  
                  line via options.                                           
   sccmap         decomposes digraphs into strongly connected components and  
                  an auxiliary map of the relationship between components. In 
                  this map, each component is collapsed into a node. The      
                  resulting graphs are printed to stdout.                     
   sfdp           draws undirected graphs using the âspringâ model, but it    
                  uses a multi-scale approach to produce layouts of large     
                  graphs in a reasonably short time.                          
   tred           computes the transitive reduction of directed graphs, and   
                  prints the resulting graphs to standard output. This        
                  removes edges implied by transitivity. Nodes and subgraphs  
                  are not otherwise affected.                                 
   twopi          draws graphs using a radial layout. Basically, one node is  
                  chosen as the center and put at the origin. The remaining   
                  nodes are placed on a sequence of concentric circles        
                  centered about the origin, each a fixed radial distance     
                  from the previous circle.                                   
   unflatten      is a preprocessor to dot that is used to improve the aspect 
                  ratio of graphs having many leaves or disconnected nodes.   
                  The usual layout for such a graph is generally very wide or 
                  tall.                                                       
   vimdot         is a simple script which launches the gvim or vim editor    
                  along with a GUI window showing the dot output of the       
                  edited file.                                                
   libcdt.so      manages run-time dictionaries using standard container data 
                  types: unordered set/multiset, ordered set/multiset, list,  
                  stack, and queue.                                           
   libcgraph.so   supports graph programming by maintaining graphs in memory  
                  and reading and writing graph files. Graphs are composed of 
                  nodes, edges, and nested subgraphs.                         
   libgvc.so      provides a context for applications wishing to manipulate   
                  and render graphs. It provides a command line parsing,      
                  common rendering code, and a plugin mechanism for           
                  renderers.                                                  
   libpathplan.so contains functions to find the shortest path between two    
                  points in a simple polygon.                                 
   libxdot.so     provides support for parsing and deparsing graphical        
                  operations specificed by the xdot language.

GTK-Doc-1.32

  Introduction to GTK-Doc

   The GTK-Doc package contains a code documenter. This is useful for
   extracting specially formatted comments from the code to create API
   documentation. This package is optional; if it is not installed, packages
   will not build the documentation. This does not mean that you will not

ImageMagick-6.9.10-60

  Introduction to ImageMagick-6 libraries

   ImageMagick underwent many changes in its libraries between versions 6 and
   7. Most packages in BLFS which use ImageMagick can use version 7, but for
   the others this page will install only the libraries, headers and general
   documentation (not programs, manpages, perl modules), and it will rename
   the unversioned pkgconfig files so that they do not overwrite the
   same-named files from version 7.

   This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS-9.0
   platform.

   Now, as the root user:

 make DOCUMENTATION_PATH=/usr/share/doc/imagemagick-6.9.10 install-libs-only

   To test the installation, issue: make check. Note that the EPS, PS, and
   PDF tests require a working Ghostscript. One test in 'make check' needs
   âHelveticaâ from âGhostscript Standard Fontsâ, which are optionally
   installed in ghostscript-9.27 - that test, and one other, might fail, but
   all the validation can still pass.

  Command Explanations

   patch -Np1 -i ../ImageMagick-6.9.10-imagemagick6_libs_only-1.patch: Move
   unversioned pkgconfig files to versioned names and provide an option to
   only install libraries and associated files.

   --enable-hdri: Enables building of a high dynamic range version of
   ImageMagick.

   --with-modules: Enables support for dynamically loadable modules.

   --disable-static: This switch prevents installation of static versions of
   the libraries.

   --with-gslib: Enables support to use the Ghostscript shared library.

   --with-rsvg: Enables support to use the librsvg library.

   --with-autotrace: Enables support to use the Autotrace library.

   --with-gvc: Enables support to use GraphViz.

   --with-windows-font-dir= <Some/Directory>: This option specifies the
   directory where the Windows CoreFonts are installed.

   --with-dejavu-font-dir= <Some/Directory>: This option specifies the
   directory where the DejaVu fonts are installed.

   The options and parameters listed above are the only ones you should have
   to pass to the configure script to activate all the delegate dependencies.
   All other dependencies will be automatically detected and utilized in the
   build if they are installed.

  Installation of ImageMagick

   Install ImageMagick by running the following commands:

 ./configure --prefix=/usr     \
             --sysconfdir=/etc \
             --enable-hdri     \
             --with-modules    \
             --with-perl       \
             --disable-static  &&
 make

   Now, as the root user:

 make DOCUMENTATION_PATH=/usr/share/doc/imagemagick-7.0.8 install

   To test the installation, issue: make check. A more comprehensive test is
   the ImageMagick validation suite. If make check has not been executed, run
   make tests/validate to compile it. Issue tests/validate 2>&1 | tee
   validate.log to run the validation suite. Note that the EPS, PS, and PDF
   tests require a working Ghostscript. One test in 'make check' needs
   âHelveticaâ from âGhostscript Standard Fontsâ, which are optionally
   installed in ghostscript-9.27 - that test, and one other, might fail, but
   all the validation can still pass.

  Command Explanations

   --enable-hdri: Enables building of a high dynamic range version of
   ImageMagick.

   --with-modules: Enables support for dynamically loadable modules.

   --with-perl: Enables building and installing of PerlMagick.

   --disable-static: This switch prevents installation of static versions of
   the libraries.

   --with-gslib: Enables support to use the Ghostscript shared library.

   --with-rsvg: Enables support to use the librsvg library.

   --with-autotrace: Enables support to use the Autotrace library.

  Configuring unixODBC

    Config Files

   /etc/unixODBC/*

    Configuration Information

   The files in /etc/unixODBC are meant to be configured by the system
   administrator (or the ODBC site administrator if appropriate privileges
   are granted to /etc/unixODBC). These files are not meant to be directly
   edited. The ODBC installer library is responsible for reading and writing
   the unixODBC config files.

   Unfortunately, there are not many man, or any info pages for the various
   programs available in the unixODBC package. Along with the information in
   the âShort Descriptionsâ below and the documentation installed in
   /usr/share/doc/unixODBC-2.3.7, there are many README files throughout the
   source tree where the use and functionality of the programs can be found.
   Additionally, you can use the parameter -? for syntax and usage
   information. Lastly, the unixODBC web site at http://www.unixodbc.org/ has
   very good information.

               and to format/output results. It can be used in batch or       
               interactive mode.                                              
   iusql       provides the same functionality as the isql program.           
   odbc_config is used to find out details about the installation of the      
               unixODBC package.                                              
   odbcinst    is a utility created for install script/RPM writers. It is a   
               command line interface to key functionality in the libodbcinst 
               library. It does not copy any files (i.e., libraries) but it   
               will modify the ODBC System Information for the user.          
   slencheck   is a utility which attempts to check whether an ODBC driver    
               was built with 32-bit or 64-bit SQLLEN types.

   It listens on netlink interface and when an event occurs, executes
   programs to handle the event. The programs it executes are configured
   through a set of configuration files, which can be dropped into place by
   packages or by the user.

   This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS-9.0
   platform.

  Installation of acpid

   Install acpid by running the following commands:

 ./configure --prefix=/usr \
             --docdir=/usr/share/doc/acpid-2.0.32 &&
 make

   This package does not come with a test suite.

   Now, as the root user:

 make install                         &&
 install -v -m755 -d /etc/acpi/events &&
 cp -r samples /usr/share/doc/acpid-2.0.32

  Configuring acpid

   acpid is configured by user defined events. Place event files under
   /etc/acpi/events directory. If an event occurs, acpid recurses through the
   event files in order to see if the regex defined after "event" matches. If
   they do, action is executed.

   The following brief example will suspend the system when the laptop lid is
   closed (it requires pm-utils-1.4.1):

 cat > /etc/acpi/events/lid << "EOF"
 event=button/lid
 action=/etc/acpi/lid.sh
 EOF

 cat > /etc/acpi/lid.sh << "EOF"
 #!/bin/sh
 /bin/grep -q open /proc/acpi/button/lid/LID/state && exit 0
 /usr/sbin/pm-suspend
 EOF
 chmod +x /etc/acpi/lid.sh

   Unfortunately, not every computer labels ACPI events in the same way. To
   determine how your buttons are recognized, use the acpi_listen tool. Also,
   look in the samples directory under /usr/share/doc/acpid-2.0.32 for more
   examples.

    Boot Script

   To automatically start acpid when the system is rebooted, install the
   /etc/rc.d/init.d/acpid boot script from the blfs-bootscripts-20190609
   package.

 make install-acpid

  Contents

   Installed Programs: acpid, acpi_listen, and kacpimon
   Installed Libraries: None
   Installed Directories: /etc/acpi and /usr/share/doc/acpid-2.0.32

    Short Descriptions

   acpid       is a program that listens for ACPI events and executes the     
               rules that match the received event.                           
   acpi_listen is a simple tool which connects to acpid and listens for       
               events.                                                        
   kacpimon    is a monitor program that connects to three sources of ACPI    
               events (events file, netlink and input layer) and then reports 
               on what it sees while it is connected.

autofs-5.1.5

  Introduction to Autofs

   Autofs controls the operation of the automount daemons. The automount
   daemons automatically mount filesystems when they are accessed and unmount
   them after a period of inactivity. This is done based on a set of
   pre-configured maps.

   This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS-9.0
   platform.

     * Estimated build time: 0.1 SBU

    Autofs Dependencies

      Required

   libtirpc-1.1.4 and rpcsvc-proto-1.4

      Optional

   nfs-utils-2.4.1, libxml2-2.9.9, MIT Kerberos V5-1.17, OpenLDAP-2.4.48
   (client only), and Cyrus SASL-2.1.27

   User Notes: http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/autofs

  Kernel Configuration

   Verify that automounter kernel support has been enabled:

 File systems --->
   <*/M> Kernel automounter version 4 support (also supports v3) [CONFIG_AUTOFS4_FS]

   Optionally, enable the following options in the kernel configuration:

 File systems  --->
   [*] Network File Systems  --->                                      [CONFIG_NETWORK_FILESYSTEMS]
     <*/M> NFS client support                                          [CONFIG_NFS_FS]
     <*/M> CIFS support (advanced network filesystem, SMBFS successor) [CONFIG_CIFS]

   Recompile and install the new kernel, if necessary.

  Installation of Autofs

   Install Autofs by running the following commands:

 ./configure --prefix=/         \
             --with-libtirpc    \
             --without-openldap \
             --mandir=/usr/share/man &&
 make

   This package does not come with a test suite.

   Now, as the root user:

 make install

  Caution

   If autofs is already installed on your system, be sure to backup your
   configuration files. They'll be overwritten by the following command.

   Install the default configuration files, still as the root user:

 make install_samples

  Command Explanations

   --with-libtirpc: This switch forces the package to use libtirpc for RPC
   functionality instead of relying on implementation from Glibc, which was
   removed in LFS 8.1.

   --without-openldap: This switch disables openldap if found. If openldap is
   desired, omit this switch. Note that openldap support in autofs requires
   MIT Kerberos V5-1.17.

  Configuring Autofs

    Config Files

   /etc/sysconfig/autofs.conf, /etc/auto.master, /etc/auto.misc, and
   /etc/auto.net

    Configuration Information

   The installation process creates auto.master, auto.misc, auto.smb, and
   auto.net. Replace the auto.master file with the following commands as the
   root user:

 mv /etc/auto.master /etc/auto.master.bak &&
 cat > /etc/auto.master << "EOF"
 # Begin /etc/auto.master

 /media/auto  /etc/auto.misc  --ghost
 #/home        /etc/auto.home

 # End /etc/auto.master
 EOF

   This file creates a new media directory, /media/auto that will overlay any
   existing directory of the same name. In this example, the file,
   /etc/auto.misc, has a line:

 cd   -fstype=iso9660,ro,nosuid,nodev :/dev/cdrom

   that will mount a cdrom as /media/auto/cd if that directory is accessed.
   The --ghost option tells the automounter to create âghostâ versions (i.e.
   empty directories) of all the mount points listed in the configuration
   file regardless whether any of the file systems are actually mounted or
   not. This is very convenient and highly recommended, because it will show
   you the available auto-mountable file systems as existing directories,
   even when their file systems aren't currently mounted. Without the --ghost
   option, you'll have to remember the names of the directories. As soon as
   you try to access one of them, the directory will be created and the file
   system will be mounted. When the file system gets unmounted again, the
   directory is destroyed too, unless the --ghost option was given.

  Note

   An alternative method would be to specify another automount location such
   as /var/lib/auto/cdrom and create a symbolic link from /media/cdrom to the
   automount location.

   The auto.misc file must be configured to your working hardware. The loaded
   configuration file should load your cdrom if /dev/cdrom is active or it
   can be edited to match your device setup. Examples for floppies are
   available in the file and easily activated. Documentation for this file is
   available using the man 5 autofs command.

   In the second line, if enabled, a user's home directory would be mounted
   via NFS upon login. The /etc/home.auto would need to exist and have an
   entry similar to:

 joe  example.org:/export/home/joe

   where the directory /export/home/joe is exported via NFS from the system
   example.org. NFS shares are covered on the next page.

   This package could also be used to mount SMB shares, however that feature
   is not configured in these instructions. For additional configuration
   information, see the man pages for auto.master(5). There are also web
   resources such as this AUTOFS HOWTO available.

    Boot Script

   autofs installs its own boot script, but it has no capability for logging
   or visual conformance with other BLFS scripts.

   Install the /etc/init.d/autofs mount script included with the
   blfs-bootscripts-20190609 package.

 make install-autofs

   The time-out variable is set in /etc/sysconfig/autofs.conf. The installed
   file sets a default of 60 seconds of inactivity before unmounting the
   device. A much shorter time may be necessary to protect buffer writing to
   a floppy if users tend to remove the media prior to the timeout setting.

   User Notes: http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/bluez

  Kernel Configuration

   If you are building this package to use bluetooth devices (rather than as
   a build dependency), enable the following options in the kernel
   configuration, also the options below the next paragraph if you intend to
   run the tests, and recompile the kernel if necessary:

 [*] Networking support --->                [CONFIG_NET]
   </M> Bluetooth subsystem support --->    [CONFIG_BT]
     <*/M> RFCOMM protocol support          [CONFIG_BT_RFCOMM]
     [*]   RFCOMM TTY support               [CONFIG_BT_RFCOMM_TTY]
     <*/M> BNEP protocol support            [CONFIG_BT_BNEP]
     [*]   Multicast filter support         [CONFIG_BT_BNEP_MC_FILTER]
     [*]   Protocol filter support          [CONFIG_BT_BNEP_PROTO_FILTER]
     <*/M> HIDP protocol support            [CONFIG_BT_HIDP]
         Bluetooth device drivers --->
           (Select the appropriate drivers for your Bluetooth hardware)

   <*/M> RF switch subsystem support --->   [CONFIG_RFKILL]

   If you wish to run the testsuite (even if treating this package as a build
   dependency), you will need to enable the following options in the kernel
   configuration and recompile the kernel if necessary:

 [*] Networking support --->                                     [CONFIG_NET]
 -*- Cryptographic API --->                                      [CONFIG_CRYPTO]
   </M> User-space interface for hash algorithms                 [CONFIG_CRYPTO_USER_API_HASH]
   </M> User-space interface for symmetric key cipher algorithms [CONFIG_CRYPTO_USER_API_SKCIPHER]

  Installation of BlueZ

   If you are going to use BlueZ with gnome-bluetooth and/or kde bluedevil,
   apply the following patch:

 patch -Np1 -i ../bluez-5.50-obexd_without_systemd-1.patch

   Install BlueZ by running the following commands:

 ./configure --prefix=/usr         \
             --sysconfdir=/etc     \
             --localstatedir=/var  \
             --enable-library      \
             --disable-systemd     &&
 make

   To test the results, issue: make check.

   Now, as the root user:

 make install &&
 ln -svf ../libexec/bluetooth/bluetoothd /usr/sbin

   Install the main configuration file as the root user:

 install -v -dm755 /etc/bluetooth &&
 install -v -m644 src/main.conf /etc/bluetooth/main.conf

   If desired, install the API documentation as the root user:

 install -v -dm755 /usr/share/doc/bluez-5.50 &&
 install -v -m644 doc/*.txt /usr/share/doc/bluez-5.50

  Command Explanations

   --enable-library: This switch enables building the BlueZ 4 compatibility
   library which is required by some applications.

   --disable-systemd: This switch is needed because systemd is not part of
   LFS/BLFS. If you are using systemd, remove this switch.

   ln -svf ../libexec/bluetooth/bluetoothd /usr/sbin: This command makes
   access to the bluetooth daemon more convenient.

  Configuring BlueZ

    Configuration Files

   /etc/bluetooth/main.conf is installed automatically during the install.
   Additionally, there are three supplementary configuration files.

   First, clean up about 100 warnings:

 mv po/fur.po po/ur.po &&
 sed -i 's/fur/ur/' po/LINGUAS

   Install Colord by running the following commands:

 mkdir build &&
 cd    build &&

 meson --prefix=/usr            \
       --sysconfdir=/etc        \
       --localstatedir=/var     \
       -Ddaemon_user=colord     \
       -Dvapi=true              \
       -Dsystemd=false          \
       -Dlibcolordcompat=true   \
       -Dargyllcms_sensor=false \
       -Dbash_completion=false  \
       -Ddocs=false             \
       -Dman=false ..           &&
 ninja

   Now, as the root user:

 ninja install

   To test the results, issue: ninja -k 2 test. One test,
   colord-self-test-daemon, will fail. The test suite must be run after the
   package is installed, and the system-wide D-Bus Daemon must be running.

  Command Explanations

   -Ddaemon_user=colord: This switch is used so the colord daemon will run as
   an unprivileged user instead of the root user.

   -Dvapi=true: This switch enables building the Vala bindings. Remove if you
   don't have Vala-0.44.7 installed.

   -Dsystemd=false: This switch disables support for systemd login in Colord
   applications.

   -Dlibcolordcompat=true: This switch enables building a compatibility
   library for older packages that use Colord.

   -Dargyllcms_sensor=false: This switch disables the ArgLLCMS sensor driver.
   Omit if you have ArgyllCMS installed and wish to use it.

   -Dbash_completion=false: This switch disables Bash Completion support for
   Colord applications.

   -Ddocs=false: This switch disables building of documentation. Omit if you
   have GTK-Doc-1.32 available.

   -Dman=false: This switch disables building of man pages. Omit if you have
   DocBook-utils-0.6.14 available. Namespaced versions of the docbook-xsl
   stylesheets are also required.

dbus-1.12.16

  Introduction to D-Bus

   D-Bus is a message bus system, a simple way for applications to talk to
   one another. D-Bus supplies both a system daemon (for events such as ânew
   hardware device addedâ or âprinter queue changedâ) and a
   per-user-login-session daemon (for general IPC needs among user
   applications). Also, the message bus is built on top of a general
   one-to-one message passing framework, which can be used by any two
   applications to communicate directly (without going through the message
   bus daemon).

   This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS-9.0
   platform.

    Package Information

     * Download (HTTP):
       https://dbus.freedesktop.org/releases/dbus/dbus-1.12.16.tar.gz

     * Download MD5 sum: 2dbeae80dfc9e3632320c6a53d5e8890

     * Download size: 2.0 MB

     * Estimated disk space required: 21 MB (add 17 MB for the tests)

     * Estimated build time: 0.3 SBU (add 8.5 SBU for the tests)

    D-Bus Dependencies

      Recommended

   Xorg Libraries (for dbus-launch program) and elogind-241.3 (These are
   circular dependencies. First build without them, and then again after both
   packages are installed.)

      Optional

   For the tests: dbus-glib-0.110, D-Bus Python-1.2.8, PyGObject-3.32.2, and
   Valgrind-3.15.0; for documentation: Doxygen-1.8.16, xmlto-0.0.28,
   Ducktype, and Yelp Tools

   User Notes: http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/dbus

  Installation of D-Bus

   Install D-Bus by running the following commands (you may wish to review
   the output from ./configure --help first and add any desired parameters to
   the configure command shown below):

 ./configure --prefix=/usr                        \
             --sysconfdir=/etc                    \
             --localstatedir=/var                 \
             --enable-user-session                \
             --disable-doxygen-docs               \
             --disable-xml-docs                   \
             --disable-static                     \
             --with-systemduserunitdir=no         \
             --with-systemdsystemunitdir=no       \
             --docdir=/usr/share/doc/dbus-1.12.16 \
             --with-console-auth-dir=/run/console \
             --with-system-pid-file=/run/dbus/pid \
             --with-system-socket=/run/dbus/system_bus_socket &&
 make

   See below for test instructions.

   Now, as the root user:

 make install

   The shared library needs to be moved to /lib, and as a result the .so file
   in /usr/lib will need to be recreated. Run the following command as the
   root user:

 mv -v /usr/lib/libdbus-1.so.* /lib &&
 ln -sfv ../../lib/$(readlink /usr/lib/libdbus-1.so) /usr/lib/libdbus-1.so

   If you are using a DESTDIR install, dbus-daemon-launch-helper needs to be
   fixed afterwards. Issue, as root user:

 chown -v root:messagebus /usr/libexec/dbus-daemon-launch-helper &&
 chmod -v      4750       /usr/libexec/dbus-daemon-launch-helper

   If you are still building your system in chroot or you did not start the
   daemon yet, but you want to compile some packages that require D-Bus,
   generate the D-Bus UUID to avoid warnings when compiling some packages
   with the following command as the root user:

 dbus-uuidgen --ensure

   If using elogind-241.3, create a symlink to the /var/lib/dbus/machine-id
   file:

 ln -sv /var/lib/dbus/machine-id /etc

   The dbus tests cannot be run until after dbus-glib-0.110 has been
   installed. They must be run as an unprivileged user from a local session
   with bus address. To run the standard tests issue make check.

   If you want to run the unit regression tests, configure requires
   additional parameters which expose additional functionality in the
   binaries that are not intended to be used in a production build of D-Bus.
   If you would like to run the tests, issue the following commands (for the
   tests, you don't need to build the docs):

 make distclean                     &&
 ./configure --enable-tests         \
             --enable-asserts       \
             --disable-doxygen-docs \
             --disable-xml-docs     &&
 make                               &&
 make check

   The test test-bus.sh is known to fail. There has also been reports that
   the tests may fail if running inside a Midnight Commander shell. You may
   get out-of-memory error messages when running the tests. These are normal
   and can be safely ignored.

  Command Explanations

   --disable-doxygen-docs: This switch disables doxygen documentation build
   and install, if you have doxygen installed. If doxygen is installed, and
   you wish to build them, remove this parameter.

   --disable-xml-docs: This switch disables html documentation build and
   install, if you have xmlto installed. If xmlto is installed, and you wish
   to build them, remove this parameter.

   --disable-static: This switch prevents installation of static versions of
   the libraries.

   --enable-user-session: This parameter enables per-user DBus sessions with
   elogind.

   --with-systemd{user,system}unitdir=: These switches disable installation
   of systemd units on elogind based systems.

   --with-console-auth-dir=/run/console/: This parameter specifies the
   directory to check for console ownerhip.

   --with-system-pid-file=/run/dbus/pid: This parameter specifies the
   location of the PID file.

   --with-system-socket=/run/dbus/system_bus_socket: This parameter specifies
   the location of the system bus socket.

   --enable-tests: Build extra parts of the code to support all tests. Do not
   use on a production build.

   --enable-embedded-tests: Build extra parts of the code to support only
   unit tests. Do not use on a production build.

   --enable-asserts: Enable debugging code to run assertions for statements
   normally assumed to be true. This prevents a warning that '--enable-tests'
   on its own is only useful for profiling and might not give true results
   for all tests, but adds its own NOTE that this should not be used in a
   production build.

  Configuring D-Bus

    Config Files

   /etc/dbus-1/session.conf, /etc/dbus-1/system.conf and
   /etc/dbus-1/system.d/*

    Configuration Information

   The configuration files listed above should probably not be modified. If
   changes are required, you should create /etc/dbus-1/session-local.conf
   and/or /etc/dbus-1/system-local.conf and make any desired changes to these
   files.

   If any packages install a D-Bus .service file outside of the standard
   /usr/share/dbus-1/services directory, that directory should be added to
   the local session configuration. For instance,
   /usr/local/share/dbus-1/services can be added by performing the following
   commands as the root user:

 cat > /etc/dbus-1/session-local.conf << "EOF"
 <!DOCTYPE busconfig PUBLIC
  "-//freedesktop//DTD D-BUS Bus Configuration 1.0//EN"
  "http://www.freedesktop.org/standards/dbus/1.0/busconfig.dtd">
 <busconfig>

   <!-- Search for .service files in /usr/local -->
   <servicedir>/usr/local/share/dbus-1/services</servicedir>

 </busconfig>
 EOF

    D-Bus Session Daemon

   To automatically start dbus-daemon when the system is rebooted, install
   the /etc/rc.d/init.d/dbus bootscript from the blfs-bootscripts-20190609
   package.

 make install-dbus

   Note that this boot script only starts the system-wide D-Bus daemon. Each
   user requiring access to D-Bus services will also need to run a session
   daemon as well. There are many methods you can use to start a session
   daemon using the dbus-launch command. Review the dbus-launch man page for
   details about the available parameters and options. Here are some
   suggestions and examples:

     * Add dbus-launch to the line in the ~/.xinitrc file that starts your
       graphical desktop environment.

     * If you use xdm or some other display manager that calls the
       ~/.xsession file, you can add dbus-launch to the line in your
       ~/.xsession file that starts your graphical desktop environment. The
       syntax would be similar to the example in the ~/.xinitrc file.

     * The examples shown previously use dbus-launch to specify a program to
       be run. This has the benefit (when also using the --exit-with-session
       parameter) of stopping the session daemon when the specified program
       is stopped. You can also start the session daemon in your system or
       personal startup scripts by adding the following lines:

 # Start the D-Bus session daemon
 eval `dbus-launch`
 export DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS

       This method will not stop the session daemon when you exit your shell,
       therefore you should add the following line to your ~/.bash_logout
       file:

 # Kill the D-Bus session daemon
 kill $DBUS_SESSION_BUS_PID

     * A hint has been written that provides ways to start scripts using the
       KDM session manager of KDE. The concepts in this hint could possibly
       be used with other session managers as well. The hint is located at
       http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/hints/downloads/files/execute-session-scripts-using-kdm.txt.

    Short Descriptions

   dbus-cleanup-sockets               is used to clean up leftover sockets in 
                                      a directory.                            
   dbus-daemon                        is the D-Bus message bus daemon.        
   dbus-launch                        is used to start dbus-daemon from a     
                                      shell script. It would normally be      
                                      called from a user's login scripts.     
   dbus-monitor                       is used to monitor messages going       
                                      through a D-Bus message bus.            
   dbus-run-session                   start a process as a new D-Bus session. 
   dbus-send                          is used to send a message to a D-Bus    
                                      message bus.                            
   dbus-test-tool                     is a D-Bus traffic generator and test   
                                      tool; it is a multi-purpose tool for    
                                      debugging and profiling D-Bus.          
   dbus-update-activation-environment is used to update the environment used  
                                      for D-Bus session services; it updates  
                                      the list of environment variables used  
                                      by dbus-daemon --session when it        
                                      activates session services without      
                                      using systemd.                          
   dbus-uuidgen                       is used to generate a universally       
                                      unique ID.                              
   libdbus-1.so                       contains the API functions used by the  
                                      D-Bus message daemon. D-Bus is first a  
                                      library that provides one-to-one        
                                      communication between any two           
                                      applications; dbus-daemon is an         
                                      application that uses this library to   
                                      implement a message bus daemon.

elogind-241.3

  Introduction to elogind

   elogind is the systemd project's "logind", extracted out to be a
   standalone daemon. It integrates with Linux-PAM-1.3.1 to know the set of
   users that are logged in to a system and whether they are logged in
   graphically, on the console, or remotely. Elogind exposes this information
   via the standard org.freedesktop.login1 D-Bus interface, as well as
   through the file system using systemd's standard /run/systemd layout.

   This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS-9.0
   platform.

  Installation of elogind

   Install elogind by running the following commands:

 mkdir build &&
 cd    build &&

 meson --prefix=/usr                        \
       --sysconfdir=/etc                    \
       --localstatedir=/var                 \
       -Dcgroup-controller=elogind          \
       -Ddbuspolicydir=/etc/dbus-1/system.d \
       ..  &&
 ninja

   This package does not come with a test suite.

   Now, as the root user:

 ninja install                                         &&
 ln -sfv  libelogind.pc /usr/lib/pkgconfig/libsystemd.pc &&
 ln -sfvn elogind /usr/include/systemd

  Command Explanations

   -Dcgroup-controller=elogind: This switch ensures that elogind is selected
   as the cgroup controller, even if booted with another running cgroup
   controller.

   -Ddbuspolicydir=/etc/dbus-1/system.d: This switch sets the location of the
   D-Bus policy directory.

   ln -s ...: These commands install symlinks so that software packages find
   systemd compatible library and headers.

  Configuring elogind

   To automatically start elogind when the system is rebooted, install the
   /etc/rc.d/init.d/mountcgroupfs and /etc/rc.d/init.d/elogind bootscripts
   from the blfs-bootscripts-20190609 package.

 make install-elogind

   Note that this boot script only starts the system-wide elogind daemon.
   Each user will also need to register a user session using Linux-PAM at
   login. The /etc/pam.d/system-session file needs to be modified and a new
   file needs to be created in order for elogind to work correctly. Run the
   following commands as the root user:

 cat >> /etc/pam.d/system-session << "EOF" &&
 # Begin elogind addition
    
 session  required    pam_loginuid.so
 session  optional    pam_elogind.so

 # End elogind addition
 EOF
 cat > /etc/pam.d/elogind-user << "EOF"
 # Begin /etc/pam.d/elogind-user

 account  required    pam_access.so
 account  include     system-account

 session  required    pam_env.so
 session  required    pam_limits.so
 session  required    pam_unix.so
 session  required    pam_loginuid.so
 session  optional    pam_keyinit.so force revoke
 session  optional    pam_elogind.so

 auth     required    pam_deny.so

Fcron-3.2.1

  Introduction to Fcron

   The Fcron package contains a periodical command scheduler which aims at
   replacing Vixie Cron.

   This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS-9.0
   platform.

    Package Information

     * Download (HTTP): http://fcron.free.fr/archives/fcron-3.2.1.src.tar.gz

     * Download MD5 sum: bd4996e941a40327d11efc5e3fd1f839

     * Download size: 587 KB

     * Estimated disk space required: 5.1 MB

     * Estimated build time: 0.1 SBU

    Fcron Dependencies

      Optional

   An MTA, text editor (default is vi from the Vim-8.1.1846 package),
   Linux-PAM-1.3.1, and DocBook-utils-0.6.14

   User Notes: http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/fcron

  Installation of Fcron

   Fcron uses the cron facility of syslog to log all messages. Since LFS does
   not set up this facility in /etc/syslog.conf, it needs to be done prior to
   installing Fcron. This command will append the necessary line to the
   current /etc/syslog.conf (perform as the root user):

 cat >> /etc/syslog.conf << "EOF"
 # Begin fcron addition to /etc/syslog.conf

 cron.* -/var/log/cron.log

 # End fcron addition
 EOF

   The configuration file has been modified, so reloading the sysklogd daemon
   will activate the changes (again as the root user).

 /etc/rc.d/init.d/sysklogd reload

   For security reasons, an unprivileged user and group for Fcron should be
   created (perform as the root user):

 groupadd -g 22 fcron &&
 useradd -d /dev/null -c "Fcron User" -g fcron -s /bin/false -u 22 fcron

   Install Fcron by running the following commands:

 ./configure --prefix=/usr          \
             --sysconfdir=/etc      \
             --localstatedir=/var   \
             --without-sendmail     \
             --with-boot-install=no \
             --with-systemdsystemunitdir=no &&
 make

   This package does not come with a test suite.

   Now, as the root user:

 make install

   DESTDIR install must be done as root user.

  Command Explanations

   --without-sendmail: By default, Fcron will attempt to use the sendmail
   command from an MTA package to email you the results of the fcron script.
   This switch is used to disable default email notification. Omit the switch
   to enable the default. Alternatively, you can use the
   --with-sendmail=</path/to/MTA command> to use a different mailer command.

   --with-boot-install=no: This prevents installation of the bootscript
   included with the package.

   --with-systemdsystemunitdir=no: This prevents building the systemd units,
   which are not needed for a SYS V system.

   --with-editor=</path/to/editor>: This switch allows you to set the default
   text editor.

   --with-dsssl-dir=</path/to/dsssl-stylesheets>: May be used if you have
   DocBook-utils-0.6.14 installed. Currently, the dsssl stylesheets are
   located at /usr/share/sgml/docbook/dsssl-stylesheets-1.79.

  Configuring Fcron

    Config Files

   /etc/fcron.conf, /etc/fcron.allow, and /etc/fcron.deny

    Configuration Information

   There are no required changes in any of the config files. Configuration
   information can be found in the man page for fcron.conf.

   fcron scripts are written using fcrontab. Refer to the fcrontab man page
   for proper parameters to address your situation.

   If Linux-PAM is installed, two PAM configuration files are installed in
   /etc/pam.d. Alternatively if /etc/pam.d is not used, the installation will
   append two configuration sections to the existing /etc/pam.conf file. You
   should ensure the files match your preferences. Modify them as required to
   suit your needs.

      Periodic Jobs

   If you would like to setup a periodic hierarchy for the root user, first
   issue the following commands (as the root user to create the
   /usr/bin/run-parts script:

 cat > /usr/bin/run-parts << "EOF" &&
 #!/bin/sh
 # run-parts:  Runs all the scripts found in a directory.
 # from Slackware, by Patrick J. Volkerding with ideas borrowed
 # from the Red Hat and Debian versions of this utility.

 # keep going when something fails
 set +e

 if [ $# -lt 1 ]; then
   echo "Usage: run-parts <directory>"
   exit 1
 fi

 if [ ! -d $1 ]; then
   echo "Not a directory: $1"
   echo "Usage: run-parts <directory>"
   exit 1
 fi

 # There are several types of files that we would like to
 # ignore automatically, as they are likely to be backups
 # of other scripts:
 IGNORE_SUFFIXES="~ ^ , .bak .new .rpmsave .rpmorig .rpmnew .swp"

 # Main loop:
 for SCRIPT in $1/* ; do
   # If this is not a regular file, skip it:
   if [ ! -f $SCRIPT ]; then
     continue
   fi
   # Determine if this file should be skipped by suffix:
   SKIP=false
   for SUFFIX in $IGNORE_SUFFIXES ; do
     if [ ! "$(basename $SCRIPT $SUFFIX)" = "$(basename $SCRIPT)" ]; then
       SKIP=true
       break
     fi
   done
   if [ "$SKIP" = "true" ]; then
     continue
   fi
   # If we've made it this far, then run the script if it's executable:
   if [ -x $SCRIPT ]; then
     $SCRIPT || echo "$SCRIPT failed."
   fi
 done

 exit 0
 EOF
 chmod -v 755 /usr/bin/run-parts

   Next, create the directory layout for the periodic jobs (again as the root
   user):

 install -vdm754 /etc/cron.{hourly,daily,weekly,monthly}

   Finally, add the run-parts to the system fcrontab (while still the root
   user):

 cat > /var/spool/fcron/systab.orig << "EOF"
 &bootrun 01 * * * * root run-parts /etc/cron.hourly
 &bootrun 02 4 * * * root run-parts /etc/cron.daily
 &bootrun 22 4 * * 0 root run-parts /etc/cron.weekly
 &bootrun 42 4 1 * * root run-parts /etc/cron.monthly
 EOF

    Boot Script

   Install the /etc/rc.d/init.d/fcron init script from the
   blfs-bootscripts-20190609 package.

 make install-fcron

   Finally, again as the root user, start fcron and generate the
   /var/spool/fcron/systab file:

 /etc/rc.d/init.d/fcron start &&
 fcrontab -z -u systab

  Contents

   Installed Programs: fcron, fcrondyn, fcronsighup, and fcrontab
   Installed Libraries: None
   Installed Directories: /usr/share/doc/fcron-3.2.1 and /var/spool/fcron

    Short Descriptions

   fcron       is the scheduling daemon.                                      
   fcrondyn    is a user tool intended to interact with a running fcron       
               daemon.                                                        
   fcronsighup instructs fcron to reread the Fcron tables.                    
   fcrontab    is a program used to install, edit, list and remove the tables 
               used by fcron.

GPM-1.20.7

  Introduction to GPM

   The GPM (General Purpose Mouse daemon) package contains a mouse server for
   the console and xterm. It not only provides cut and paste support
   generally, but its library component is used by various software such as
   Links to provide mouse support to the application. It is useful on
   desktops, especially if following (Beyond) Linux From Scratch
   instructions; it's often much easier (and less error prone) to cut and
   paste between two console windows than to type everything by hand!

   This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS-9.0
   platform.

  Kernel Configuration

   Enable the following option in the kernel configuration and recompile the
   kernel if necessary:

 Device Drivers  --->
   Input device support ---> [CONFIG_INPUT]
     <*/M> Mouse interface   [CONFIG_INPUT_MOUSEDEV]

  Installation of GPM

   Install GPM by running the following commands:

 sed -i -e 's:<gpm.h>:"headers/gpm.h":' src/prog/{display-buttons,display-coords,get-versions}.c &&
 patch -Np1 -i ../gpm-1.20.7-glibc_2.26-1.patch &&
 ./autogen.sh                                &&
 ./configure --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc &&
 make

   This package does not come with a test suite.

   Now, as the root user:

                     /usr/share/doc/gpm-1.20.7

  Command Explanations

   ./autogen.sh: This command creates the missing configure script.

   install-info ...: This package installs an .info file, but does not update
   the system dir file. This command makes the update.

   ln -v -sfn libgpm.so.2.1.0 /usr/lib/libgpm.so: This command is used to
   create (or update) the .so symlink to the library.

  Configuring GPM

    Boot Script

   Install the /etc/rc.d/init.d/gpm init script included in the
   blfs-bootscripts-20190609 package.

 make install-gpm

    Config Files

   /etc/gpm-root.conf and ~/.gpm-root: The default and individual user
   gpm-root configuration files.

   /etc/sysconfig/mouse: This file contains the name of your mouse device and
   the protocol it uses. To create this file, run the following as the root
   user:

 cat > /etc/sysconfig/mouse << "EOF"
 # Begin /etc/sysconfig/mouse

 MDEVICE="<yourdevice>"
 PROTOCOL="<yourprotocol>"
 GPMOPTS="<additional options>"

 # End /etc/sysconfig/mouse
 EOF

    Configuration Information

   Examples of values to set MDEVICE, PROTOCOL, and GPMOPTS to are:

 MDEVICE="/dev/input/mice"
 PROTOCOL="imps2"
 GPMOPTS=""

   A list of which protocol values are known can be found by running gpm -m
   [device] -t -help. The MDEVICE setting depends on which type of mouse you
   have. For example, /dev/ttyS0 for a serial mouse (on Windows this is
   COM1), /dev/input/mice is often used for USB mice and /dev/psaux for PS2
   mice. GPMOPTS is the 'catch all' for any additional options that are
   needed for your hardware.

  Kernel Configuration

   Getting your kernel config right is an iterative process that may require
   that you recompile your kernel a couple of times. The simplest way to go
   about it is to start by enabling modules and then compile everything that
   may be needed by Lm Sensors as a module:

 [*] Enable loadable module support  --->  [CONFIG_MODULES]

 Bus options (PCI etc.)  --->

  Installation of lm_sensors

   Install lm_sensors by running the following commands:

 make PREFIX=/usr        \
      BUILD_STATIC_LIB=0 \
      MANDIR=/usr/share/man

   This package does not come with a test suite.

   Now, as the root user:

 make PREFIX=/usr        \
      BUILD_STATIC_LIB=0 \
      MANDIR=/usr/share/man install &&

 install -v -m755 -d /usr/share/doc/lm_sensors-3.4.0 &&
 cp -rv              README INSTALL doc/* \
                     /usr/share/doc/lm_sensors-3.4.0

  Command Explanations

   BUILD_STATIC_LIB=0: This parameter disables compiling and installing the
   static version of libsensors.

   PROG_EXTRA=sensord: This parameter enables compiling sensord, a daemon
   that can monitor your system at regular intervals. Compiling sensord
   requires RRDtool. Compiling RRDtool 1.4.6 requires a sed: sed -i '/
   sv_undef/d' bindings/perl-shared/RRDs.xs.

  Configuring Lm Sensors

    Config File

   /etc/sensors3.conf

    Configuration Information

   To find out what hardware sensors your system has, issue the following
   command as the root user:

 sensors-detect

   The appropriate modules should have been loaded and a summary is displayed
   at the end. Now you know what is needed and you can recompile your kernel
   to enable just the options you need (i.e., don't enable the modules you
   cannot use).

   Installed Programs: fancontrol, isadump, isaset, pwmconfig, sensors,
   sensors-conf-convert, sensors-detect, and optionally, sensord
   Installed Library: libsensors.so
   Installed Directories: /etc/sensors.d, /usr/include/sensors and
   /usr/share/doc/lm_sensors-3.4.0

    Short Descriptions

   fancontrol           is a shell script for use with lm_sensors. It reads   
                        its configuration from a file, then calculates fan    
                        speeds from temperatures and sets the corresponding   
                        PWM outputs to the computed values.                   
   isadump              is a small helper program to examine registers        
                        visible through the ISA bus. It is intended to probe  
                        any chip that lives on the ISA bus working with an    
                        address register and a data register (I2C-like        
                        access) or a flat range (of up to 256 bytes).         
   isaset               is a small helper program to set registers visible    
                        through the ISA bus.                                  
   pwmconfig            tests the pulse width modulation (PWM) outputs of     
                        sensors and configures fancontrol.                    
   sensors              prints the current readings of all sensor chips.      
   sensors-conf-convert is a Perl script to convert lm-sensors version 2      
                        configuration files to work with version 3.           
   sensors-detect       is a Perl script that will walk you through the       
                        process of scanning your system for various hardware  
                        monitoring chips (sensors) supported by libsensors,   
                        or more generally by the lm_sensors tool suite.       
   sensord              (optional) is a daemon that can be used to            
                        periodically log sensor readings.                     
   libsensors.so        contains the lm_sensors API functions.

Logrotate-3.15.0

  Introduction to Logrotate

   The logrotate package allows automatic rotation, compression, removal, and
   mailing of log files.

   This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS-9.0
   platform.

    Package Information

     * Download (HTTP):
       https://github.com/logrotate/logrotate/releases/download/3.15.0/logrotate-3.15.0.tar.xz

     * Download MD5 sum: 320046f0b9fc38337e8827d4c5a866a0

     * Download size: 156 KB

     * Estimated disk space required: 4.9 MB

     * Estimated build time: 0.1 SBU (with tests)

    Logrotate Dependencies

      Required

   popt-1.16

      Recommended

   Fcron-3.2.1 (runtime)

      Optional

   An MTA (runtime)

   User Notes: http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/logrotate

  Installation of Logrotate

   Install logrotate by running the following command:

 ./configure --prefix=/usr        &&
 make

   To test the results, issue: make test. One test fails because the very old
   compress is not present and two tests fail if an MTA is not installed.

   Now, as the root user:

 make install

  Configuring Logrotate

   Logrotate needs a configuration file, which must be passed as an argument
   to the command when executed. Create the file as the root user:

 cat > /etc/logrotate.conf << EOF
 # Begin of /etc/logrotate.conf

 # Rotate log files weekly
 weekly

 # Don't mail logs to anybody
 nomail

 # If the log file is empty, it will not be rotated
 notifempty

 # Number of backups that will be kept
 # This will keep the 2 newest backups only
 rotate 2

 # Create new empty files after rotating old ones
 # This will create empty log files, with owner
 # set to root, group set to sys, and permissions 644
 create 0664 root sys

 # Compress the backups with gzip
 compress

 # No packages own lastlog or wtmp -- rotate them here
 /var/log/wtmp {
     monthly
     create 0664 root utmp
     rotate 1
 }

 /var/log/lastlog {
     monthly
     rotate 1
 }

 # Some packages drop log rotation info in this directory
 # so we include any file in it.
 include /etc/logrotate.d

 # End of /etc/logrotate.conf
 EOF

 chmod -v 0644 /etc/logrotate.conf

   Now create the /etc/logrotate.d directory as the root user:

  mkdir -p /etc/logrotate.d

   At this point additional log rotation commands can be entered, typically
   in the /etc/logrotate.d directory. For example:

 cat > /etc/logrotate.d/sys.log << EOF
 /var/log/sys.log {
    # If the log file is larger than 100kb, rotate it
    size   100k
    rotate 5
    weekly
    postrotate
       /bin/killall -HUP syslogd
    endscript
 }
 EOF

 chmod -v 0644 /etc/logrotate.d/sys.log

   You can designate multiple files in one entry:

 cat > /etc/logrotate.d/example.log << EOF
 file1
 file2
 file3 {
    ...
    postrotate
     ...
    endscript
 }
 EOF

 chmod -v 0644 /etc/logrotate.d/example.log

   You can use in the same line the list of files: file1 file2 file3. See the
   logrotate man page or
   http://www.techrepublic.com/article/manage-linux-log-files-with-logrotate/
   for more examples.

   The command logrotate /etc/logrotate.conf can be run manually, however,
   the command should be run daily. Other useful commands are logrotate -d
   /etc/logrotate.conf for debugging purposes and logrotate -f
   /etc/logrotate.conf forcing the logrotate commands to be run immediately.
   Combining the previous options -df, you can debug the effect of the force
   command. When debugging, the command is only simulated, not really run,
   thus, eventual non-existing errors appear, when some intermediate files
   are expected, because they are not actually created.

   To run the logrotate daily, if you've installed Fcron-3.2.1 and completed
   the section on periodic jobs, execute the following commands, as the root
   user, to create a daily cron job:

 install -vdm 754 /etc/cron.daily            &&
 cat > /etc/cron.daily/logrotate.sh << "EOF" &&
 #!/bin/bash
 /usr/sbin/logrotate /etc/logrotate.conf
 EOF
 chmod 754 /etc/cron.daily/logrotate.sh

Pax-20161104

  Introduction to Pax

   pax is an archiving utility created by POSIX and defined by the
   POSIX.1-2001 standard. Rather than sort out the incompatible options that
   have crept up between tar and cpio, along with their implementations
   across various versions of UNIX, the IEEE designed a new archive utility.
   The name âpaxâ is an acronym for portable archive exchange. Furthermore,
   âpaxâ means âpeaceâ in Latin, so its name implies that it shall create
   peace between the tar and cpio format supporters. The command invocation
   and command structure is somewhat a unification of both tar and cpio.

   pax has been required to be present in LSB conformant systems since LSB
   version 3.0.

   This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS-9.0
   platform.

      Recommended

   cURL-7.65.3, Wget-1.20.3, OR Lynx-2.8.9rel.1 (for the update-pciids script
   to function correctly).

   User Notes: http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/pciutils

  Installation of PCI Utils

   Install PCI Utils by running the following commands:

 make PREFIX=/usr                \
      SHAREDIR=/usr/share/hwdata \
      SHARED=yes

   This package does not come with a test suite.

   Now, as the root user:

 make PREFIX=/usr                \
      SHAREDIR=/usr/share/hwdata \
      SHARED=yes                 \
      install install-lib        &&

 chmod -v 755 /usr/lib/libpci.so

  Command Explanations

   SHARED=yes: This parameter enables building of the shared library instead
   of the static one.

   ZLIB=no: This option prevents compression of the pci.ids file.

  Configuring PCI Utils

   The pci.ids data file is constantly being updated. To get a current
   version of this file, run update-pciids as the root user. This program
   requires the Which-2.21 script or program to find cURL-7.65.3,
   Lynx-2.8.9rel.1 or Wget-1.20.3 which are used to download the most current
   file, and then replace the existing file in /usr/share/hwdata.

   You should update the /usr/share/hwdata/pci.ids file periodically. If
   you've installed Fcron-3.2.1 and completed the section on periodic jobs,
   execute the following commands, as the root user, to create a weekly cron
   job:

 cat > /etc/cron.weekly/update-pciids.sh << "EOF" &&

pm-utils-1.4.1

  Introduction to Power Management Utilities

   The Power Management Utilities provide simple shell command line tools to
   suspend and hibernate the computer. They can be used to run user supplied
   scripts on suspend and resume.

   This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS-9.0
   platform.

   User Notes: http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/pm-utils

  Kernel Configuration

   If needed, enable the following options in the kernel configuration and
   recompile the kernel:

 Power management and ACPI options --->
     <*> Suspend to RAM and standby            [CONFIG_SUSPEND]
     <*> Hibernation (aka 'suspend to disk')   [CONFIG_HIBERNATION]

   Suspend to RAM allows the system to enter sleep states in which main
   memory is powered and thus its contents are preserved. The method cuts
   power to most parts of the machine aside from the RAM. Because of the
   large power savings, it is advisable for laptops to automatically enter
   this mode when the computer is running on batteries and the lid is closed
   (or the user is inactive for some time).

   Suspend to disk (Hibernation) saves the machine's state into swap space
   and completely powers off the machine. When the machine is powered on, the
   state is restored. Until then, there is zero power consumption. Suspend to
   RAM and hibernation are normally appropriate for portable devices such as
   laptops, but can be used on workstations. The capability is not really
   appropriate for servers.

   To use hibernation, the kernel parameter resume=/dev/<swap_partition> has
   to be used on the kernel command line (in grub.cfg). The swap partition
   should be at least the size of the physical RAM on the system.

  Installation of Power Management Utilities

   Install Power Management Utilities by running the following commands:

 ./configure --prefix=/usr     \
             --sysconfdir=/etc \
             --docdir=/usr/share/doc/pm-utils-1.4.1 &&
 make

   This package does not come with a test suite.

   Now, as the root user:

 make install

   If you don't have xmlto-0.0.28 installed, copy pregenerated man pages, as
   the root user:

 install -v -m644 man/*.1 /usr/share/man/man1 &&
 install -v -m644 man/*.8 /usr/share/man/man8 &&
 ln -sv pm-action.8 /usr/share/man/man8/pm-suspend.8 &&
 ln -sv pm-action.8 /usr/share/man/man8/pm-hibernate.8 &&
 ln -sv pm-action.8 /usr/share/man/man8/pm-suspend-hybrid.8

  Configuring Power Management Utilities

   Suspend or resume functionality can be easily modified by installing files
   into the /etc/pm/sleep.d directory. These files, known as hooks, are run
   when the system is put into a sleep state or resumed. Default hooks are
   located in /usr/lib/pm-utils/sleep.d, and user hooks should be put in
   /etc/pm/sleep.d. See the pm-action(8) man page for more information.

   In order to use hibernation with GRUB and a swap partition, you need to
   add kernel parameter resume=swap_partition (e.g. resume=/dev/sda1) to the
   kernel line in the /boot/grub/grub.cfg configuration file.

    Short Descriptions

   on_ac_power       is a script that determines whether the system is        
                     running on AC power (rather than a battery).             
   pm-hibernate      is a symlink to pm-action script that puts the computer  
                     into hibernate mode (the system is fully powered off and 
                     system state is saved to disk).                          
   pm-is-supported   is a script that checks whether power management         
                     features such as suspend and hibernate are supported.    
   pm-powersave      is a script that puts the computer into powersaving (low 
                     power) mode.                                             
   pm-suspend        is a symlink to pm-action script that puts the computer  
                     into suspend mode (most devices are shut down and system 
                     state is saved in RAM).                                  
   pm-suspend-hybrid is a symlink to pm-action script that puts the computer  
                     into hybrid-suspend mode (the system does everything it  
                     needs to hibernate, but suspends instead of shutting     
                     down).

Sysstat-12.1.6

  Introduction to Sysstat

   The Sysstat package contains utilities to monitor system performance and
   usage activity. Sysstat contains the sar utility, common to many
   commercial Unixes, and tools you can schedule via cron to collect and
   historize performance and activity data.

   This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS-9.0
   platform.

    Package Information

     * Download (HTTP):
       http://sebastien.godard.pagesperso-orange.fr/sysstat-12.1.6.tar.xz

     * Download MD5 sum: d8e3bbb9c873dd370f6d33664e326570

     * Download size: 668 KB

     * Estimated disk space required: 18 MB

     * Estimated build time: 0.1 SBU

    Sysstat Dependencies

   There are no build-time requirements for this package; however, it is
   designed to be controlled by a cron daemon such as Fcron-3.2.1.

   User Notes: http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/sysstat

  Installation of Sysstat

   Install Sysstat by running the following commands:

 sa_lib_dir=/usr/lib/sa    \
 sa_dir=/var/log/sa        \
 conf_dir=/etc/sysconfig   \
 ./configure --prefix=/usr \
             --disable-file-attr &&
 make

   This package does not come with a test suite.

   Now, as the root user:

 make install

  Command Explanations

   sa_lib_dir: This environment variable specifies the location of the
   package-specific library directory.

   sa_dir: This environment variable specifies the location of the directory
   containing the data files.

   conf_dir: This environment variable specifies the location of the system
   configuration directory.

   --disable-file-attr: Do not set attributes on files being installed. This
   parameter causes the installation to ignore the man group variable
   resulting in the man files having root: root ownership.

  Note

   Run ./configure --help to see other influential environment variables you
   can pass to configure. You may want to use the history and compressafter
   variables to customize the amount of data files kept on the system.

  Configuring Sysstat

    Config Files

   /etc/sysconfig/sysstat and /etc/sysconfig/sysstat.ioconf

    Cron Information

   To begin gathering Sysstat history information, you must add to, or create
   a privileged user's crontab. The history data location is /var/log/sa. The
   user running Sysstat utilities via cron must have write access to this
   location.

   Below is an example of what to install in the crontab. Adjust the
   parameters to suit your needs. Use man sa1 and man sa2 for information
   about the commands.

 # 8am-7pm activity reports every 10 minutes during weekdays
 0 8-18 * * 1-5 /usr/lib/sa/sa1 600 6 &

 # 7pm-8am activity reports every hour during weekdays
 0 19-7 * * 1-5 /usr/lib/sa/sa1 &

 # Activity reports every hour on Saturday and Sunday
 0 * * * 0,6 /usr/lib/sa/sa1 &

 # Daily summary prepared at 19:05
 5 19 * * * /usr/lib/sa/sa2 -A &

   Ensure you submit the revised crontab to the cron daemon.

    System Startup Information

   At system startup, a LINUX RESTART message must be inserted in the daily
   data file to reinitialize the kernel counters. This can be automated by
   installing the /etc/rc.d/init.d/sysstat init script included in the
   blfs-bootscripts-20190609 package using the following command as the root
   user:

 make install-sysstat

  Contents

   Installed Programs: cifsiostat, iostat, mpstat, pidstat, sadf, sar, and
   tapestat
   Installed Libraries: None
   Installed Directories: /usr/lib/sa, /usr/share/doc/sysstat-12.1.6 and
   /var/log/sa

    Short Descriptions

   cifsiostat displays statistics about read and write operations on CIFS     
              filesystems.                                                    
   iostat     reports CPU statistics and input/output statistics for devices  
              and partitions.                                                 
   mpstat     writes activities for each available processor.                 
   pidstat    is used for monitoring individual tasks currently being managed 
              by the Linux kernel.                                            
   sadf       is used for displaying the contents of data files created by    
              the sar command. But unlike sar, sadf can write its data in     
              many different formats.                                         
   sar        is used for displaying the contents of elected cumulative       
              activity counters in the operating system.                      
   tapestat   is used for monitoring the activity of tape drives connected to 
              a system.

UnZip-6.0

  Introduction to UnZip

   The UnZip package contains ZIP extraction utilities. These are useful for
   extracting files from ZIP archives. ZIP archives are created with PKZIP or
   Info-ZIP utilities, primarily in a DOS environment.

   This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS-9.0
   platform.

  Caution

   The previous version of the UnZip package had some locale related issues.
   Currently there are no BLFS editors capable of testing these locale
   issues. Therefore, the locale related information is left on this page,
   but has not been tested. A more general discussion of these problems can
   be found in the Program Assumes Encoding section of the Locale Related
   Issues page.

   User Notes: http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/unzip

  UnZip Locale Issues

  Note

   Use of UnZip in the JDK, Mozilla, DocBook or any other BLFS package
   installation is not a problem, as BLFS instructions never use UnZip to
   extract a file with non-ASCII characters in the file's name.

   The UnZip package assumes that filenames stored in the ZIP archives
   created on non-Unix systems are encoded in CP850, and that they should be
   converted to ISO-8859-1 when writing files onto the filesystem. Such
   assumptions are not always valid. In fact, inside the ZIP archive,
   filenames are encoded in the DOS codepage that is in use in the relevant
   country, and the filenames on disk should be in the locale encoding. In MS
   Windows, the OemToChar() C function (from User32.DLL) does the correct
   conversion (which is indeed the conversion from CP850 to a superset of
   ISO-8859-1 if MS Windows is set up to use the US English language), but
   there is no equivalent in Linux.

   When using unzip to unpack a ZIP archive containing non-ASCII filenames,
   the filenames are damaged because unzip uses improper conversion when any
   of its encoding assumptions are incorrect. For example, in the
   ru_RU.KOI8-R locale, conversion of filenames from CP866 to KOI8-R is
   required, but conversion from CP850 to ISO-8859-1 is done, which produces
   filenames consisting of undecipherable characters instead of words (the
   closest equivalent understandable example for English-only users is
   rot13). There are several ways around this limitation:

   1) For unpacking ZIP archives with filenames containing non-ASCII
   characters, use WinZip while running the Wine Windows emulator.

   2) After running unzip, fix the damage made to the filenames using the
   convmv tool (http://j3e.de/linux/convmv/). The following is an example for
   the ru_RU.KOI8-R locale:

     Step 1. Undo the conversion done by unzip:

 convmv -f iso-8859-1 -t cp850 -r --nosmart --notest \
     </path/to/unzipped/files>

     Step 2. Do the correct conversion instead:

 convmv -f cp866 -t koi8-r -r --nosmart --notest \
     </path/to/unzipped/files>

  Installation of UnZip

 make -f unix/Makefile generic

   The test suite does not work for present target âgenericâ.

   Now, as the root user:

 make prefix=/usr MANDIR=/usr/share/man/man1 \
  -f unix/Makefile install

  Command Explanations

   make -f unix/Makefile generic: This target begins by running a configure
   script (unlike the older targets such as linux and linux_noasm) which
   creates a flags file that is then used in the build. This ensures that the
   32-bit x86 build receives the right flags to unzip files which which are
   larger than 2GB when extracted.

  Contents

   Installed Programs: funzip, unzip, unzipfsx, zipgrep, and zipinfo
   Installed Libraries: None
   Installed Directories: None

    Short Descriptions

   funzip   allows the output of unzip commands to be redirected.             
   unzip    lists, tests or extracts files from a ZIP archive.                
   unzipfsx is a self-extracting stub that can be prepended to a ZIP archive. 
            Files in this format allow the recipient to decompress the        
            archive without installing UnZip.                                 
   zipgrep  searches files in a ZIP archive for lines matching a pattern.     
   zipinfo  produces technical information about the files in a ZIP archive,  
            including file access permissions, encryption status, type of     
            compression, etc.

  Installation of USB Utils

   Install USB Utils by running the following commands:

 ./autogen.sh --prefix=/usr --datadir=/usr/share/hwdata &&
 make

   This package does not come with a test suite.

   Now, as the root user:

 make install

   To install the usb.ids data file, using Wget-1.20.3, run, as the root
   user:

 install -dm755 /usr/share/hwdata/ &&
 wget http://www.linux-usb.org/usb.ids -O /usr/share/hwdata/usb.ids

   The script lsusb.py displays information in a more easily readable form
   than lsusb. To find the options, use lsusb.py -h. One form of use
   recommended by the developer is lsusb.py -ciu.

  Configuring USB Utils

   The usb.ids data file is constantly being updated. To get a current
   version of this file, using Wget-1.20.3, periodically run again, as the
   root user:

 wget http://www.linux-usb.org/usb.ids -O /usr/share/hwdata/usb.ids

   You should update the /usr/share/hwdata/usb.ids file periodically. If
   you've installed Fcron-3.2.1 and completed the section on periodic jobs,
   execute the following commands, as the root user, to create a weekly cron
   job:

 cat > /etc/cron.weekly/update-usbids.sh << "EOF" &&
 #!/bin/bash
 /usr/bin/wget http://www.linux-usb.org/usb.ids -O /usr/share/hwdata/usb.ids
 EOF
 chmod 754 /etc/cron.weekly/update-usbids.sh

  Contents

   Installed Programs: lsusb, lsusb.py, usb-devices, and usbhid-dump
   Installed Libraries: None
   Installed Directories: None

    Short Descriptions

   lsusb       is a utility for displaying information about all USB buses in 
               the system and all devices connected to them, but not in human 
               friendly form.                                                 
   lsusb.py    displays information about all USB buses in the system and all 
               devices connected to them in reasonable human friendly form.   
   usb-devices is a shell script that displays details of USB buses and       
               devices connected to them. It is designed to be used if        
               /proc/bus/usb/devices is not available on your system.         
   usbhid-dump is used to dump report descriptors and streams from HID (human 
               interface device) interfaces of USB devices.

Which-2.21 and Alternatives

   The presence or absence of the which program in the main LFS book is
   probably one of the most contentious issues on the mailing lists. It has
   resulted in at least one flame war in the past. To hopefully put an end to
   this once and for all, presented here are two options for equipping your
   system with which. The question of which âwhichâ is for you to decide.

  Introduction to GNU Which

   The first option is to install the actual GNU which package.

   This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS-9.0
   platform.

    Package Information

     * Download (HTTP): https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/which/which-2.21.tar.gz

     * Download (FTP): ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/which/which-2.21.tar.gz

     * Download MD5 sum: 097ff1a324ae02e0a3b0369f07a7544a

     * Download size: 148 KB

     * Estimated disk space required: 1 MB

     * Estimated build time: less than 0.1 SBU

   User Notes: http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/which

  Installation of Which

   Install which by running the following commands:

 ./configure --prefix=/usr &&
 make

   This package does not come with a test suite.

   Now, as the root user:

 make install

  Contents

   Installed Program: which
   Installed Libraries: None
   Installed Directories: None

    Short Descriptions

   which shows the full path of (shell) commands installed in your PATH. 

  The 'which' Script

   The second option (for those who don't want to install the package) is to
   create a simple script (execute as the root user):

 cat > /usr/bin/which << "EOF"
 #!/bin/bash
 type -pa "$@" | head -n 1 ; exit ${PIPESTATUS[0]}
 EOF
 chmod -v 755 /usr/bin/which
 chown -v root:root /usr/bin/which

   This should work OK and is probably the easiest solution for most cases,
   but is not the most comprehensive implementation.

   User Notes: http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/zip

  Installation of Zip

   Install Zip by running the following commands:

 make -f unix/Makefile generic_gcc

   This package does not come with a test suite.

   Now, as the root user:

 make prefix=/usr MANDIR=/usr/share/man/man1 -f unix/Makefile install

  Command Explanations

   make prefix=/usr -f unix/Makefile install: This command overrides the
   prefix variable that is set to /usr/local in the unix/Makefile.
   Alternatives to generic_gcc can be seen with a make -f unix/Makefile list
   command.

  Contents

   Installed Programs: zip, zipcloak, zipnote, and zipsplit
   Installed Libraries: None
   Installed Directories: None

    Short Descriptions

   zip      compresses files into a ZIP archive.                
   zipcloak is a utility to encrypt and decrypt a ZIP archive.  
   zipnote  reads or writes comments stored in a ZIP file.      
   zipsplit is a utility to split ZIP files into smaller files.

Chapter 13. Programming

   A base LFS system can be used as a development platform, however the base
   system only includes language support for C, C++ and Perl. This chapter
   provides instructions to build many popular programming environments to
   greatly expand your system's development capabilities.

Autoconf2.13

  Introduction to Autoconf2.13

   Autoconf2.13 is an old version of Autoconf . This old version accepts
   switches which are not valid in more recent versions. Now that firefox has
   started to use python2 for configuring, this old version is required even
   if configure files have not been changed.

   This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS-9.0
   platform.

    Package Information

     * Download (HTTP): https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/autoconf/autoconf-2.13.tar.gz

     * Download (FTP): ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/autoconf/autoconf-2.13.tar.gz

     * Estimated build time: less than 0.1 SBU (additional 0.1 SBU for the
       tests)

    Additional Downloads

     * Required patch:
       http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/patches/blfs/9.0/autoconf-2.13-consolidated_fixes-1.patch

    Autoconf2.13 Dependencies

      Optional

   DejaGnu-1.6.2 (Required for the tests)

   User Notes: http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/autoconf213

  Installation of Autoconf2.13

   Install Autoconf by running the following commands:

 patch -Np1 -i ../autoconf-2.13-consolidated_fixes-1.patch &&
 mv -v autoconf.texi autoconf213.texi                      &&
 rm -v autoconf.info                                       &&
 ./configure --prefix=/usr --program-suffix=2.13           &&
 make

   To test the installation, if you have installed DejaGnu-1.6.2, issue make
   check (all 253 tests should pass).

   Now, as the root user:

 make install                                      &&
 install -v -m644 autoconf213.info /usr/share/info &&
 install-info --info-dir=/usr/share/info autoconf213.info

  Command Explanations

   mv -v autoconf.texi autoconf213.texi: ensure that the info file added by
   this package will not overwrite the more recent version.

   rm -v autoconf.info: ensure that the info file will be created by the
   current version of texinfo.

   --program-suffix=2.13: ensure that the installed programs have the version
   added to their names, so that only a script which specifically looks for
   these old versions will find them.

   install -v -m644 ...: the patch removes install-info from the Makefile
   because that would install (and if necessary recreate) standards.info
   which is an old version, so now autoconf213.info has to be manually
   installed.

  Contents

   Installed Programs: autoconf2.13, autoheader2.13, autoreconf2.13,
   autoscan2.13, autoupdate2.13, and ifnames2.13
   Installed Library: None
   Installed Directory: /usr/share/autoconf-2.13

    Short Descriptions

   autoconf2.13   Produces shell scripts that automatically configure         
                  software source code packages to adapt to many kinds of     
                  Unix-like systems.                                          
   autoheader2.13 is a tool for creating template files of C #define          
                  statements for configure to use                             
   autoreconf2.13 This automatically runs autoconf2.13, autoheader2.13,       
                  aclocal, automake, gettextize and libtoolize in the right   
                  order when changes have been made to autoconf or automake   
                  template files.                                             
   autoscan2.13   Can be used as a preliminary step in creating a             
                  configure.in file.                                          
   autoupdate2.13 Modifies a configure.in file that still calls autoconf      
                  macros by their old names to use the current macro names.   
   ifnames2.13    Prints the identifiers that the package uses in C           
                  preprocessor conditionals [If a package has already been    
                  set up to have some portability, this program can help      
                  determine what configure needs to check for. It can also    
                  fill in gaps in a configure.in file generated by autoscan.]

      Optional

   libffcall

   User Notes: http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/clisp

  Installation of Clisp

  Note

   This package does not support parallel build.

   Remove two tests, which fail for unknown reasons:

 sed -i -e '/socket/d' -e '/"streams"/d' tests/tests.lisp

   Install Clisp by running the following commands:

   If you are building clisp against libffcall, apply the patch to fix a
   build failure with current readline:

 patch -Np1 -i ../clisp-2.49-readline7_fixes-1.patch

   Install Clisp by running the following commands:

 ulimit -s 16384 &&
 make -j1

   To test the results, issue: make check.

   Now, as the root user:

 make install

  Command Explanations

   ulimit -s 16384: this increases the maximum stack size, as recommended by
   the configure.

   --docdir=/usr/share/doc/clisp-2.49: this ensures the html documentation
   will go into a versioned directory instead of straight into
   /usr/share/html/.

   --with-libsigsegv-prefix=/usr: use this to tell configure that you have
   installed libsigsegv in /usr, otherwise it will not be found.

   --with-libffcall-prefix=/usr: use this to tell configure that you have
   installed the optional libffcall in /usr, otherwise like libsigsegv it
   will not be found.

CMake-3.15.2

  Introduction to CMake

   The CMake package contains a modern toolset used for generating Makefiles.
   It is a successor of the auto-generated configure script and aims to be
   platform- and compiler-independent. A significant user of CMake is KDE
   since version 4.

   This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS-9.0
   platform.

    Package Information

             --no-system-librhash \
             --docdir=/share/doc/cmake-3.15.2 &&
 make

   To test the results, issue: bin/ctest -j<N> -O cmake-3.15.2-test.log,
   where <N> is an integer between 1 and the number of system cores. In case
   the environment variable LANG is set to a non-blank value and failures
   occur, try running the tests without having LANG set. One test,
   RunCMake.CommandLineTar, is known to fail.

   Now, as the root user:

Doxygen-1.8.16

  Introduction to Doxygen

   The Doxygen package contains a documentation system for C++, C, Java,
   Objective-C, Corba IDL and to some extent PHP, C# and D. It is useful for
   generating HTML documentation and/or an off-line reference manual from a
   set of documented source files. There is also support for generating
   output in RTF, PostScript, hyperlinked PDF, compressed HTML, and Unix man
   pages. The documentation is extracted directly from the sources, which
   makes it much easier to keep the documentation consistent with the source
   code.

   You can also configure Doxygen to extract the code structure from
   undocumented source files. This is very useful to quickly find your way in
   large source distributions. Used along with Graphviz, you can also
   visualize the relations between the various elements by means of include
   dependency graphs, inheritance diagrams, and collaboration diagrams, which
   are all generated automatically.

   This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS-9.0
   platform.

 cd       build &&

 cmake -G "Unix Makefiles"         \
       -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release  \
       -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr \
       -Wno-dev .. &&

 make

   To test the results, issue: make tests. One test, 012_cite.dox, is known
   to fail.

   If you wish to generate the package documentation, you must have Python,
   TeX Live (for HTML docs) and Ghostscript (for PDF docs) installed, then
   issue the following command:

 cmake -DDOC_INSTALL_DIR=share/doc/doxygen-1.8.16 -Dbuild_doc=ON .. &&

 make docs

   Now, as the root user:

 make install &&
 install -vm644 ../doc/*.1 /usr/share/man/man1

   If you have generated the package documentation, then the man pages are
   automatically installed, and you do not need to run the last install ...
   command.

  Command Explanations

   -Dbuild_wizard=ON: Use this switch if Qt5 is installed and you wish to
   build the GUI front-end.

   -Dbuild_search=ON: Use this switch if xapian is installed and you wish to
   build external search tools (doxysearch.cgi and doxyindexer).

   -Duse_libclang=ON: Use this switch if llvm with clang are installed, to
   add support for libclang parsing.

  Configuring Doxygen

   There is no real configuration necessary for the Doxygen package although
   three additional packages are required if you wish to use extended
   capabilities. If you need to use the language translation features, you
   must have Python-2.7.16 installed. If you require formulas to create PDF
   documentation, then you must have texlive-20190410 installed. If you
   require formulas to convert PostScript files to bitmaps, then you must
   have ghostscript-9.27 installed.

    Short Descriptions

   doxygen        is a command-line based utility used to generate template   
                  configuration files and then generate documentation from    
                  these templates. Use doxygen --help for an explanation of   
                  the command-line parameters.                                
   doxywizard     is a GUI front-end for configuring and running doxygen.     
   doxyindexer    generates a search index called doxysearch.db from one or   
                  more search data files produced by doxygen. See, e.g.       
                  http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/manual/extsearch.html. 
   doxysearch.cgi is a CGI program to search the data indexed by doxyindexer.

Expect-5.45.4

  Introduction to Expect

   The Expect package was installed in the LFS temporary tools directory for
   testing other packages. These procedures install it in a permanent
   location. It contains tools for automating interactive applications such
   as telnet, ftp, passwd, fsck, rlogin, tip, etc. Expect is also useful for
   testing these same applications as well as easing all sorts of tasks that
   are prohibitively difficult with anything else.

   This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS-9.0
   platform.

   passmass           changes a password on multiple machines.                
   rftp               is much like ftp except it uses ~g and ~p instead of    
                      mget and mput.                                          
   rlogin-cwd         is rlogin except it uses the local current directory as 
                      the current working directory on the remote machine.    
   timed-read         reads a complete line from stdin and aborts after a     
                      given number of seconds.

   multixterm         creates multiple xterms that can be driven together or  
                      separately.                                             
   tknewsbiff         pops up a window when there is unread news in your

GCC-9.2.0

  Introduction to GCC

   The GCC package contains the GNU Compiler Collection. This page describes
   the installation of compilers for the following languages: C, C++, D,
   Fortran, Objective C, Objective C++, and Go.

   This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS-9.0
   platform.

  Caution

   If you are upgrading GCC from any other version prior to 9.2.0, then you
   must be careful compiling 3rd party kernel modules. You should ensure that
   the kernel and all its native modules are also compiled using the same
   version of GCC that you use to build the 3rd party module. This issue does
   not affect native kernel (and kernel modules) updates, as the instructions
   below are a complete reinstallation of GCC. If you have existing 3rd party
   modules installed, ensure they are recompiled using the updated version of
   GCC. As always, never update the kernel headers from the ones used when
   Glibc was compiled during LFS.

   Some system headers need to be fixed to be used with GCC. This is done
   during the installation of GCC, and the âfixedâ headers are installed in
   /usr/lib/gcc/<machine triplet>/<GCC version>/include-fixed . This is
   harmless if GCC is built during the LFS stage. But if you reinstall GCC in
   BLFS, some of the BLFS packages may be âfixedâ. If one of those packages
   is reinstalled afterwards, the âfixedâ headers are not updated, which may
   lead to version mismatches. In case that happens, the âfixedâ headers must
   be updated by running (as root):
   /usr/libexec/gcc/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/9.2.0/install-tools/mkheaders . The
   machine triplet may be different on a 32bit system.

       with parallelism=4)

    GCC Dependencies

      Recommended

   DejaGnu-1.6.2, for tests

      Optional

   GDB-8.3, Valgrind-3.15.0 (for tests), and ISL (to enable graphite
   optimization)

   User Notes: http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/gcc

  Installation of GCC

  Important

   Even if you specify only languages other than C and C++ to the ./configure
   command below, the installation process will overwrite your existing GCC C
   and C++ compilers and libraries. Having the Tcl, Expect and DejaGnu
   packages installed before beginning the build is highly recommended so you
   can run the full suite of tests.

   Do not continue with the make install command until you are confident the
   build was successful. You can compare your test results with those found
   at http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-testresults/. You may also want to refer to
   the information found in the GCC section of Chapter 6 in the LFS book
   (../../../../lfs/view/9.0/chapter06/gcc.html).

   The instructions below are intentionally performing a âbootstrapâ process.
   Bootstrapping is needed for robustness and is highly recommended when
   upgrading the compilers version. To disable bootstrap anyways, add
   --disable-bootstrap to the ./configure options below.

   Install GCC by running the following commands:

 case $(uname -m) in
   x86_64)
     sed -e '/m64=/s/lib64/lib/' \
         -i.orig gcc/config/i386/t-linux64
   ;;
 esac

 mkdir build                                            &&
 cd    build                                            &&

 ../configure                                           \
     --prefix=/usr                                      \
     --disable-multilib                                 \
     --with-system-zlib                                 \
     --enable-languages=c,c++,d,fortran,go,objc,obj-c++ &&
 make

   If you have installed additional packages such as Valgrind and GDB, the
   GCC part of the testsuite will run more tests than in LFS. Some of those
   will report FAIL and others XPASS (pass when expected to FAIL). As of
   gcc-9.2.0, about 100 FAIL occur in the âgualityâ suite, as well as
   miscellaneous failures throughout the rest of the test suite. If all the
   compilers above are built, there will be slightly over 120 unexpected
   failures out of over 390,000 tests. To run the tests, issue:

 ulimit -s 32768 &&
 make -k check

   The tests are very long, and the results may be hard to find in the logs,
   specially if you use parallel jobs with make. You can get a summary of the
   tests with:

 ../contrib/test_summary

   Now, as the root user:

 make install &&

 mkdir -pv /usr/share/gdb/auto-load/usr/lib              &&
 mv -v /usr/lib/*gdb.py /usr/share/gdb/auto-load/usr/lib &&

 chown -v -R root:root \
     /usr/lib/gcc/*linux-gnu/9.2.0/include{,-fixed}

 rm -rf /usr/lib/gcc/$(gcc -dumpmachine)/9.2.0/include-fixed/bits/

   Some packages expect to find the C preprocessor in /lib or may refer to
   the C compiler under the name cc. The following symbolic links are not
   needed if you have followed the LFS instructions, since they have been
   already created. If you do not have them on your system, issue as the root
   user:

 ln -v -sf ../usr/bin/cpp /lib          &&
 ln -v -sf gcc /usr/bin/cc              &&
 install -v -dm755 /usr/lib/bfd-plugins &&
 ln -sfv ../../libexec/gcc/$(gcc -dumpmachine)/9.2.0/liblto_plugin.so /usr/lib/bfd-plugins/

  Command Explanations

   mkdir build; cd build: The GCC documentation recommends building the
   package in a dedicated build directory.

   --disable-multilib: This parameter ensures that files are created for the
   specific architecture of your computer.

   --with-system-zlib: Uses the system zlib instead of the bundled one. zlib
   is used for compressing and uncompressing GCC's intermediate language in
   LTO (Link Time Optimization) object files.

   --enable-languages=c,c++,d,fortran,go,objc,obj-c++: This command
   identifies which languages to build. You may modify this command to remove
   undesired languages. Two other languages can be added, besides ADA (see
   introduction above): BRIG (add brig to the list of enabled languages), a
   binary format for HSAIL (Heterogeneous System Architecture Intermediate
   Language), and JIT (add jit to the list of enabled languages), a library
   which can be linked into interpreters that want to generate machine code
   âon the flyâ at run-time. They have not been tested by the BLFS
   developers.

   ulimit -s 32768: This command prevents several tests from running out of
   stack space.

   make -k check: This command runs the test suite without stopping if any
   errors are encountered.

   ../contrib/test_summary: This command will produce a summary of the test
   suite results. You can append | grep -A7 Summ to the command to produce an
   even more condensed version of the summary. You may also wish to redirect
   the output to a file for review and comparison later on.

   mv -v /usr/lib/*gdb.py ...: The installation stage puts some files used by
   gdb under the /usr/lib directory. This generates spurious error messages
   when performing ldconfig. This command moves the files to another
   location.

   chown -v -R root:root /usr/lib/gcc/*linux-gnu/...: If the package is built
   by a user other than root, the ownership of the installed include
   directory (and its content) will be incorrect. This command changes the
   ownership to the root user and group.

   rm -rf .../include-fixed/bits/: Remove an erroneous file in gcc added by
   the fixincludes process.

  Contents

   Some program and library names and descriptions are not listed here, but
   can be found at ../../../../lfs/view/9.0/chapter06/gcc.html#contents-gcc

GC-8.0.4

  Introduction to GC

   The GC package contains the Boehm-Demers-Weiser conservative garbage
   collector, which can be used as a garbage collecting replacement for the C
   malloc function or C++ new operator. It allows you to allocate memory
   basically as you normally would, without explicitly deallocating memory
   that is no longer useful. The collector automatically recycles memory when
   it determines that it can no longer be otherwise accessed. The collector
   is also used by a number of programming language implementations that
   either use C as intermediate code, want to facilitate easier
   interoperation with C libraries, or just prefer the simple collector
   interface. Alternatively, the garbage collector may be used as a leak
   detector for C or C++ programs, though that is not its primary goal.

   This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS-9.0
   platform.

             --docdir=/usr/share/doc/gc-8.0.4 &&
 make

   To test the results, issue: make check.

   Now, as the root user:

 make install &&
 install -v -m644 doc/gc.man /usr/share/man/man3/gc_malloc.3

  Command Explanations

   --docdir=/usr/share/doc/gc-8.0.4: This option is used so the package will
   install the documentation in a versioned directory.

   --enable-cplusplus: This parameter enables the building and installing of
   the C++ library along with the standard C library.

   --disable-static: This switch prevents installation of static versions of
   the libraries.

   Installed Programs: None
   Installed Libraries: libcord.so, libgc.so, and libgccpp.so
   Installed Directories: /usr/include/gc and /usr/share/doc/gc-8.0.4

    Short Descriptions

   libgc.so    contains a C interface to the conservative garbage collector,  
               primarily designed to replace the C malloc function.           
   libgccpp.so contains a C++ interface to the conservative garbage           
               collector.

GDB-8.3

  Introduction to GDB

   GDB, the GNU Project debugger, allows you to see what is going on âinsideâ
   another program while it executes -- or what another program was doing at
   the moment it crashed. Note that GDB is most effective when tracing
   programs and libraries that were built with debugging symbols and not
   stripped.

   This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS-9.0
   platform.

   User Notes: http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/gdb

  Installation of GDB

   Install GDB by running the following commands:

 ./configure --prefix=/usr \
             --with-system-readline \
             --with-python=/usr/bin/python3 &&
 make

   Optionally, to build the API documentation using Doxygen-1.8.16, run:

 make -C gdb/doc doxy

   To test the results, issue:

 pushd gdb/testsuite &&
 make  site.exp      &&
 echo  "set gdb_test_timeout 120" >> site.exp &&
 runtest
 popd

   See gdb/testsuite/README and TestingGDB. There are many problems with the
   test suite:

     * Clean directories are needed if re-running the tests. For that reason,
       make a copy of the compiled source code directory before the tests in
       case you need to run the tests again.

     * Results depend on installed compilers.

     * There are a large number of timeouts (there is a variable that can be
       set to increase time for timeout, but changing it will result in a
       different number of tests being run).

     * There are failures associated with system readline 6.x.

     * A few tests assume that the header file <sys/sdt.h>, part of
       SystemTap, is present.

     * If the test suite is run on a Skylake-based Intel CPU or newer, many
       tests will fail due to the removal of the deprecated/problematic
       libmpx library in GCC.

     * Approximately 1-3% of the tests fail (out of over 56000 tests).

   Now, as the root user:

 make -C gdb install

   If you have built the API documentation, it is now in gdb/doc/doxy. You
   can install it (as the root user):

 install -d /usr/share/doc/gdb-8.3 &&
 rm -rf gdb/doc/doxy/xml &&
 cp -Rv gdb/doc/doxy /usr/share/doc/gdb-8.3

  Command Explanations

   --with-system-readline: This switch forces GDB to use the copy of Readline
   installed in LFS.

   --with-python=/usr/bin/python3: This switch forces GDB to use Python 3
   installed in LFS. Remove this switch if you have installed Python-2.7.16
   and want to use it instead of Python 3.

  Contents

   Installed Programs: gcore, gdb and gdbserver
   Installed Library: libinproctrace.so
   Installed Directories: /usr/{include,share}/gdb and /usr/share/doc/gdb-8.3

    Short Descriptions

   gcore             generates a core dump of a running program.              
   gdb               is the GNU Debugger.                                     
   gdbserver         is a remote server for the GNU debugger (it allows       
                     programs to be debugged from a different machine).       
   libinproctrace.so contains functions for the in-process tracing agent. The 
                     agent allows for installing fast tracepoints, listing    
                     static tracepoint markers, probing static tracepoints    
                     markers, and starting trace monitoring.

Git-2.23.0

  Introduction to Git

   Git is a free and open source, distributed version control system designed
   to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and
   efficiency. Every Git clone is a full-fledged repository with complete
   history and full revision tracking capabilities, not dependent on network
   access or a central server. Branching and merging are fast and easy to do.
   Git is used for version control of files, much like tools such as
   Mercurial-5.1, Bazaar, Subversion-1.12.2, CVS, Perforce, and Team
   Foundation Server.

   This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS-9.0
   platform.

    Package Information

     * Download MD5 sum: 93ee0f867f81a39e0ef29eabfb1d2c5b

     * Download size: 5.4 MB

     * Estimated disk space required: 496 MB (with downloaded documentation)

     * Estimated build time: 0.4 SBU (with parallelism=4; add 9.4 SBU for
       tests)

    Additional Downloads

     * https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/git-manpages-2.23.0.tar.xz
       (not needed if you've installed asciidoc-8.6.9, xmlto-0.0.28, and
       prefer to rebuild them)

     * https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/git-htmldocs-2.23.0.tar.xz
       and other docs (not needed if you've installed asciidoc-8.6.9 and want
       to rebuild the documentation).

    Git Dependencies

      Recommended

   cURL-7.65.3 (needed to use Git over http, https, ftp or ftps)

      Optional

   pcre2-10.33 (or the deprecated PCRE-8.43), in either case configured with
   --enable-jit, Python-2.7.16, Subversion-1.12.2 with Perl bindings (for git
   svn), Tk-8.6.9 (gitk, a simple Git repository viewer, uses Tk at runtime),
   and Valgrind-3.15.0

      Optional (to create the man pages, html docs and other docs)

   xmlto-0.0.28 and asciidoc-8.6.9 or AsciiDoctor, and also dblatex (for the
   PDF version of the user manual), and docbook2x to create info pages

   User Notes: http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/git

  Installation of Git

   Install Git by running the following commands:

 ./configure --prefix=/usr --with-gitconfig=/etc/gitconfig &&
 make

   You can build the man pages and/or html docs, or use downloaded ones. If
   you choose to build them, use next two following instructions.

   If you have installed asciidoc-8.6.9 you can create the html version of
   the man pages and other docs:

 make html

   If you have installed asciidoc-8.6.9 and xmlto-0.0.28 you can create the
   man pages:

 make man

   The test suite can be run in parallel mode. To run the test suite, issue:
   make test. If run as a normal user, 0 tests should be reported as failed
   in the final summary.

   Now, as the root user:

 make install

    If you created the man pages and/or html docs

   Install the man pages as root user:

 make install-man

   Install the html docs as root user:

 make htmldir=/usr/share/doc/git-2.23.0 install-html

    If you downloaded the man pages and/or html docs

   If you downloaded the man pages untar them as the root user:

 tar -xf ../git-manpages-2.23.0.tar.xz \
     -C /usr/share/man --no-same-owner --no-overwrite-dir

   If you downloaded the html docs untar them as the root user:

 mkdir -vp   /usr/share/doc/git-2.23.0 &&
 tar   -xf   ../git-htmldocs-2.23.0.tar.xz \
       -C    /usr/share/doc/git-2.23.0 --no-same-owner --no-overwrite-dir &&

 find        /usr/share/doc/git-2.23.0 -type d -exec chmod 755 {} \; &&
 find        /usr/share/doc/git-2.23.0 -type f -exec chmod 644 {} \;

    Reorganize text and html in the html-docs (both methods)

   For both methods, the html-docs include a lot of plain text files.
   Reorganize the files as the root user:

 mkdir -vp /usr/share/doc/git-2.23.0/man-pages/{html,text}         &&
 mv        /usr/share/doc/git-2.23.0/{git*.txt,man-pages/text}     &&
 mv        /usr/share/doc/git-2.23.0/{git*.,index.,man-pages/}html &&

 mkdir -vp /usr/share/doc/git-2.23.0/technical/{html,text}         &&
 mv        /usr/share/doc/git-2.23.0/technical/{*.txt,text}        &&
 mv        /usr/share/doc/git-2.23.0/technical/{*.,}html           &&

 mkdir -vp /usr/share/doc/git-2.23.0/howto/{html,text}             &&
 mv        /usr/share/doc/git-2.23.0/howto/{*.txt,text}            &&
 mv        /usr/share/doc/git-2.23.0/howto/{*.,}html               &&

 sed -i '/^<a href=/s|howto/|&html/|' /usr/share/doc/git-2.23.0/howto-index.html &&
 sed -i '/^\* link:/s|howto/|&html/|' /usr/share/doc/git-2.23.0/howto-index.txt

  Command Explanations

   --with-gitconfig=/etc/gitconfig: This sets /etc/gitconfig as the file that
   stores the default, system wide, Git settings.

   --with-python=python3: Use this switch to allow using Python 3. Python is
   only used for the git p4 interface to Perforce repositories.

   --with-libpcre2: Use this switch if PCRE2 is installed and has been built
   with the non-default JIT enabled.

   --with-libpcre: As an alternative to PCRE2, use this switch if the
   deprecated PCRE is installed and has been built with the non-default JIT
   enabled.

   tar -xf ../git-manpages-2.23.0.tar.gz -C /usr/share/man --no-same-owner:
   This untars git-manpages-2.23.0.tar.gz. The -C option makes tar change
   directory to /usr/share/man before it starts to decompress the docs. The
   --no-same-owner option stops tar from preserving the user and group
   details of the files. This is useful as that user or group may not exist
   on your system; this could (potentially) be a security risk.

   mv /usr/share/doc/git-2.23.0 ...: These commands move some of the files
   into subfolders to make it easier to sort through the docs and find what
   you're looking for.

   find ... chmod ...: These commands correct the permissions in the shipped
   documentation tar file.

    Short Descriptions

   git                is the stupid content tracker.                          
   git-cvsserver      is a CVS server emulator for Git.                       
   gitk               is a graphical Git repository browser (needs Tk-8.6.9). 
   git-receive-pack   is invoked by git send-pack and updates the repository  
                      with the information fed from the remote end.           
   git-shell          is a login shell for SSH accounts to provide restricted 
                      Git access.                                             
   git-upload-archive is invoked by git archive --remote and sends a          
                      generated archive to the other end over the git         
                      protocol.                                               
   git-upload-pack    is invoked by git fetch-pack, it discovers what objects 
                      the other side is missing, and sends them after         
                      packing.

    Short Descriptions

   guile        is a stand-alone Scheme interpreter for Guile.                
   guile-config is a Guile script which provides the information necessary to 
                link your programs against the Guile library, in much the     
                same way PkgConfig does.                                      
   guile-snarf  is a script to parse declarations in your C code for Scheme   
                visible C functions.                                          
   guild        is a wrapper program installed along with guile, which knows  
                where a particular module is installed and calls it, passing  
                its arguments to the program.                                 
   guile-tools  is a symlink to guild.

LLVM-8.0.1

  Introduction to LLVM

   The LLVM package contains a collection of modular and reusable compiler
   and toolchain technologies. The Low Level Virtual Machine (LLVM) Core
   libraries provide a modern source and target-independent optimizer, along
   with code generation support for many popular CPUs (as well as some less
   common ones!). These libraries are built around a well specified code
   representation known as the LLVM intermediate representation ("LLVM IR").

   The optional Clang and Compiler RT packages provide new C, C++, Objective
   C and Objective C++ front-ends and runtime libraries for the LLVM and are
   required by some packages which use Rust, for example firefox.

   This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS-9.0
   platform.

    LLVM Dependencies

      Required

   CMake-3.15.2

      Optional

   Doxygen-1.8.16, Graphviz-2.40.1, libxml2-2.9.9, Python-2.7.16,
   texlive-20190410 (or install-tl-unx), Valgrind-3.15.0, PyYAML-5.1.2,
   Zip-3.0, OCaml, recommonmark, Sphinx, and Z3

   User Notes: http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/llvm

  Installation of LLVM

   If you have downloaded the optional packages, install them into the source
   tree by running the following commands:

 tar -xf ../cfe-8.0.1.src.tar.xz -C tools &&
 tar -xf ../compiler-rt-8.0.1.src.tar.xz -C projects &&

 mv tools/cfe-8.0.1.src tools/clang &&
 mv projects/compiler-rt-8.0.1.src projects/compiler-rt

   Install LLVM by running the following commands:

 mkdir -v build &&
 cd       build &&

 CC=gcc CXX=g++                                  \
 cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr               \
       -DLLVM_ENABLE_FFI=ON                      \
       -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release                \
       -DLLVM_BUILD_LLVM_DYLIB=ON                \
       -DLLVM_LINK_LLVM_DYLIB=ON                 \
       -DLLVM_ENABLE_RTTI=ON                     \
       -DLLVM_TARGETS_TO_BUILD="host;AMDGPU;BPF" \
       -DLLVM_BUILD_TESTS=ON                     \
       -Wno-dev -G Ninja ..                      &&
 ninja

   If you have installed Sphinx and recommonmark and wish to generate the
   html documentation and manual pages, issue the following commands:

 cmake -DLLVM_ENABLE_SPHINX=ON         \
       -DSPHINX_WARNINGS_AS_ERRORS=OFF \
       -Wno-dev -G Ninja ..            &&
 ninja docs-llvm-html  docs-llvm-man

   If you have downloaded the optional packages, the clang documentation can
   be built too:

 ninja docs-clang-html docs-clang-man

   To test the results, issue: ninja check-all. Tests are built with all
   available cores, but run using the number of online processors. (The
   difference is that available cores can be limited using taskset, but
   taking them offline requires echoing 0 to
   /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu<N>/online by the root user and makes them
   temporarily unusable by all jobs on the machine.) Note that the Sanitizer
   based tests (377 of more than 35000 tests run) are known to fail.

   Now, as the root user:

 ninja install

   If you have built the the llvm documentation, install it by running the
   following commands as the root user:

 install -v -m644 docs/man/* /usr/share/man/man1             &&
 install -v -d -m755 /usr/share/doc/llvm-8.0.1/llvm-html     &&
 cp -Rv docs/html/* /usr/share/doc/llvm-8.0.1/llvm-html

   If you have built the clang documentation, it can be installed in the same
   way (again as the root user):

 install -v -m644 tools/clang/docs/man/* /usr/share/man/man1 &&
 install -v -d -m755 /usr/share/doc/llvm-8.0.1/clang-html    &&
 cp -Rv tools/clang/docs/html/* /usr/share/doc/llvm-8.0.1/clang-html

  Command Explanations

   -DLLVM_ENABLE_FFI=ON: This switch enables LLVM to use libffi.

   -DLLVM_BUILD_LLVM_DYLIB=ON: builds libraries as static and links all of
   them into an unique shared one. This is the recommended way of building a
   shared library.

   -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release: This switch enables compiler optimizations in
   order to speed up the code and reduce its size. It also disables some
   compile checks, not necessary on a production system.

   -DLLVM_TARGETS_TO_BUILD="host;AMDGPU;BPF": This switch enables building
   for the same target as the host, and also for the r600 AMD GPU used by the
   Mesa r600 and radeonsi drivers. The BPF target is required to build
   v4l-utils-1.16.6. Default is all. You can use a semicolon separated list.
   Valid targets are: host, X86, Sparc, PowerPC, ARM, AArch64, Mips, Hexagon,
   Xcore, MSP430, NVPTX, SystemZ, AMDGPU, BPF, CppBackend, or all.

   -DLLVM_LINK_LLVM_DYLIB=ON: Used in conjunction with
   -DLLVM_BUILD_LLVM_DYLIB=ON, this switch enables linking the tools against
   the shared library instead of the static ones. It also slightly reduces
   their size and also ensures that llvm-config will correctly use
   libLLVM-7.0.so.

   -D=LLVM_ENABLE_RTTI=ON: Used to build LLVM with run-time type information.
   This is required for building Mesa-19.1.4.

   -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON: if used instead of -DLLVM_BUILD_LLVM_DYLIB=ON and
   -DLLVM_LINK_LLVM_DYLIB=ON, builds all the LLVM libraries (about 60) as
   shared libraries instead of static.

   -DLLVM_ENABLE_DOXYGEN: Enables the generation of browsable HTML
   documentation if you have installed Doxygen-1.8.16. You should run make
   doxygen-html afterwards, and install the generated documentation manually.

Lua-5.3.5

  Introduction to Lua

   Lua is a powerful light-weight programming language designed for extending
   applications. It is also frequently used as a general-purpose, stand-alone
   language. Lua is implemented as a small library of C functions, written in
   ANSI C, and compiles unmodified in all known platforms. The implementation
   goals are simplicity, efficiency, portability, and low embedding cost. The
   result is a fast language engine with small footprint, making it ideal in
   embedded systems too.

   This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS-9.0
   platform.

  Installation of Lua

   Some packages check for the pkg-config file for Lua, which is created
   with:

 cat > lua.pc << "EOF"
 V=5.3
 R=5.3.5

 prefix=/usr
 INSTALL_BIN=${prefix}/bin
 INSTALL_INC=${prefix}/include
 INSTALL_LIB=${prefix}/lib
 INSTALL_MAN=${prefix}/share/man/man1
 INSTALL_LMOD=${prefix}/share/lua/${V}
 INSTALL_CMOD=${prefix}/lib/lua/${V}
 exec_prefix=${prefix}
 libdir=${exec_prefix}/lib
 includedir=${prefix}/include

 Name: Lua
 Description: An Extensible Extension Language
 Version: ${R}
 Requires:
 Libs: -L${libdir} -llua -lm -ldl
 Cflags: -I${includedir}
 EOF

   Install Lua by running the following commands:

 patch -Np1 -i ../lua-5.3.5-shared_library-1.patch &&
 sed -i '/#define LUA_ROOT/s:/usr/local/:/usr/:' src/luaconf.h &&

 make MYCFLAGS="-DLUA_COMPAT_5_2 -DLUA_COMPAT_5_1" linux

   To test the results, issue: make test. âThis will run the interpreter and
   print its version.â. More comprehensive tests can be performed if you
   downloaded the "Test suite" tarball. Those tests need to be executed after
   the package is installed, thus we defer to the description below.

   Now, as the root user:

 make INSTALL_TOP=/usr                \
      INSTALL_DATA="cp -d"            \
      INSTALL_MAN=/usr/share/man/man1 \
      TO_LIB="liblua.so liblua.so.5.3 liblua.so.5.3.4" \
      install &&


 mkdir -pv                      /usr/share/doc/lua-5.3.5 &&
 cp -v doc/*.{html,css,gif,png} /usr/share/doc/lua-5.3.5 &&

 install -v -m644 -D lua.pc /usr/lib/pkgconfig/lua.pc

   Here we describe only the "Basic tests". Untar the tarball and change to
   the lua-5.3.5-tests directory, then issue lua -e "_U=true" all.lua. If the
   tests finish without error, you will see a message containing the string
   "final OK".

  Command Explanations

   sed -i ... src/luaconf.h: This command changes the Lua search path to
   match the install path.

   MYCFLAGS="-DLUA_COMPAT_5_2 -DLUA_COMPAT_5_1": This environment variable
   includes compatibility layers with Lua 5.1 and 5.2 in the build.

  Contents

   Installed Programs: lua and luac
   Installed Library: liblua.so
   Installed Directories: /usr/{lib,share}/lua and /usr/share/doc/lua-5.3.5

    Short Descriptions

   lua       is the standalone Lua interpreter. 
   luac      is the Lua compiler.

Lua-5.2.4

  Introduction to Lua 5.2

   Lua is a powerful light-weight programming language designed for extending
   applications. It is also frequently used as a general-purpose, stand-alone
   language. Lua is implemented as a small library of C functions, written in
   ANSI C, and compiles unmodified in all known platforms. The implementation
   goals are simplicity, efficiency, portability, and low embedding cost. The
   result is a fast language engine with small footprint, making it ideal in
   embedded systems too.

   This is an older verion of Lua needed only for compatibility with other
   programs such as Wireshark-3.0.3.

   This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS-9.0

Mercurial-5.1

  Introduction to Mercurial

   Mercurial is a distributed source control management tool similar to Git
   and Bazaar. Mercurial is written in Python and is used by projects such as
   Mozilla and Vim.

   This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS-9.0
   platform.

    Package Information

     * Download (HTTP):
       https://www.mercurial-scm.org/release/mercurial-5.1.tar.gz

     * Download MD5 sum: 7b1902492cee88acfc3b62caae70f636

     * Download size: 6.9 MB

     * Estimated disk space required: 74 MB (with docs, add 571 MB for tests)

     * Estimated build time: 0.5 SBU (with docs, add 10 SBU for tests using
       -j4)

    Mercurial Dependencies

      Required

   Python-2.7.16

      Optional

   docutils-0.15 (required to build the documentation), git-2.23.0,
   GnuPG-2.2.17 (gpg2 with Python bindings), OpenSSH-8.0p1 (runtime, to
   access ssh://... repositories), Pygments-2.4.2, Subversion-1.12.2 (with
   Python bindings), Bazaar, CVS, pyflakes, and pyOpenSSL

   User Notes: http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/mercurial

  Installation of Mercurial

   Build Mercurial by issuing the following command:

 make build

   To build the documentation (requires docutils-0.15), issue:

 sed -i '/runrst/s/N)/N)3/' doc/Makefile &&
 2to3-3.7 -w doc/hgmanpage.py            &&
 make doc

   To run the test suite, issue:

 rm -rf tests/tmp &&
 TESTFLAGS="-j<N> --tmpdir tmp --blacklist blacklists/fsmonitor --blacklist blacklists/linux-vfat" make check

   where <N> is an integer between one and the number of ( processor X
   threads ), inclusive. In order to investigate any apparently failing
   tests, you may use the run-tests.py script. To see the almost forty
   switches, some of them very useful, issue tests/run-tests.py --help.
   Running the following commands, you will execute only the tests that
   failed before:

 pushd tests  &&
   rm -rf tmp &&
   ./run-tests.py --tmpdir tmp test-gpg.t
 popd

   Normally, the previous failures will be confirmed. However, if you add the
   switch "--debug" before "--tmpdir", and run again, some failures are gone,
   which seems to be a problem with the test suite. If this happens,
   normally, from now on, there will be no more such failures whether you use
   the debug switch or not. Three tests, test-alias.t, test-install.t, and
   test-bundle2-exchange.t (intermittently), are known to fail.

   An interesting switch is "--time", which will generate at the end of the
   test suite execution, a table with all executed tests and respective
   start, end, user, system and real times. Note that the switches may be
   used with make check by including them in the TESTFLAGS environment
   variable.

   Install Mercurial by running the following command (as root):

 make PREFIX=/usr install-bin

   If you built the documentation, install it by running the following
   command (as root):

 make PREFIX=/usr install-doc

   After installation, two very quick and simple tests should run correctly.
   The first one needs some configuration:

 cat >> ~/.hgrc << "EOF"
 [ui]
 username = <user_name> <user@mail>
 EOF

   where you must replace <user_name> and <your@mail> (mail is optional and
   can be omitted). With the user identity defined, run hg debuginstall and
   several lines will be displayed, the last one reading "no problems
   detected". Another quick and simple test is just hg, which should output
   basic commands that can be used with hg.

  Command Explanations

   sed -i '/runrst/s/N)/N)3/' doc/Makefile: forces the use of Python 3 for
   commands using docutils, allowing to use the docutils Python 3 module.

   2to3-3.7 -w doc/hgmanpage.py: Since Python 3 is used with docutils, one
   file needs to be converted in order to be compatible.

  Configuring Mercurial

    Config Files

   /etc/mercurial/hgrc and ~/.hgrc

   The great majority of extensions are disabled by default. Run hg help
   extensions if you need to enable any, e.g. when investigating test
   failures. You will obtain the lists of enabled and disabled extensions,
   and more information, such as how to enable or disable them using
   configuration files.

   If you have installed make-ca-1.4 and want Mercurial to use them, as the
   root user, issue:

 install -v -d -m755 /etc/mercurial &&
 cat > /etc/mercurial/hgrc << "EOF"
 [web]
 cacerts = /etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt
 EOF

  Contents

   Installed Programs: hg
   Installed Libraries: several internal modules under
   /usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/mercurial
   Installed Directories: /etc/mercurial and
   /usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/{hgdemandimport,hgext,hgext3rd,mercurial}

    Short Descriptions

   hg is the mercurial version control system.

Perl Modules

  Introduction to Perl Modules

   The Perl module packages (also referred to as Distributions, because each
   can contain multiple modules) add useful objects to the Perl language. The
   packages listed on this page are required or recommended for other
   packages in the book. If they have dependent modules, those are either on
   this page or else on the next page (Perl Module Dependencies).

   In many cases, only the required or recommended dependencies are listed -
   there might be other modules which allow more tests to be run, but
   omitting them will still allow the tests to PASS.

   For a few modules, the BLFS editors have determined that other modules
   still listed as prerequisites are not required, and omitted them.

   Where an alphabetically-earlier dependency of the same module pulls in a
   dependency, it is not mentioned for the later dependencies of the same
   module. You should build the listed dependencies in order.

   It is generally worth running the tests for perl modules, they often can
   show problems such as missing dependencies which are required to use the
   module. Here, the editors have attempted to separate those dependencies
   which are only required for running testsuites, but they will not be
   mentioned for a module where one of its dependencies uses that module for
   its own testsuite. That is to say, if you intend to run the testsuites,
   please run them for each dependency of the module.

   It is possible to automatically install the current versions of a module
   and all missing or too-old dependencies recommended by upstream using
   CPAN. See CPAN automated install of perl modules at the end of this page.

   Most of these modules only install files below
   /usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.xx.y and those will not be documented. One or
   two install programs (mostly, perl scripts), or a library, into /usr/bin/
   or /usr/lib/ and these are documented.

  URI-1.76

    Introduction to URI

   This module implements the URI class. Objects of this class represent
   "Uniform Resource Identifier references" as specified in RFC 2396 (and
   updated by RFC 2732). A Uniform Resource Identifier is a compact string of
   characters that identifies an abstract or physical resource. A Uniform
   Resource Identifier can be further classified as either a Uniform Resource
   Locator (URL) or a Uniform Resource Name (URN). The distinction between
   URL and URN does not matter to the URI class interface. A "URI-reference"
   is a URI that may have additional information attached in the form of a
   fragment identifier.

   This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS-9.0
   platform.

  CPAN automated install of perl modules

    Automatic Installation of Perl Modules.

   There is an alternate way of installing the modules using the cpan shell
   install command. The command automatically downloads the latest source
   from the CPAN archive for the module and any missing prerequisite modules
   listed by upstream. Then for each module it extracts it, runs the
   compilation, the tests and installs it.

   You still need to install any non-perl dependencies before running the
   automated installation method. You may wish to clean out the build/
   directory after installing, to free up the space. If any post-install
   actions such as creating a symlink are mentioned, you should also do
   those.

   The first time you run cpan, you'll be prompted to enter some information
   regarding download locations and methods. This information is retained in
   files located in ~/.cpan.

   In particular, you may wish to configure it so that Sudo-1.8.27 is used
   for the installs, allowing you to build and test as a regular user. The
   following examples have not used that approach.

   Start the cpan shell by issuing 'cpan' as the root user. Any module may
   now be installed from the cpan>  prompt with the command:

 install <Module::Name>

   For additional commands and help, issue 'help' from the cpan>  prompt.

   Alternatively, for scripted or non-interactive installations, use the
   following syntax as the root user to install one or more modules:

 cpan -i <Module1::Name> <Module2::Name>

   Review the cpan.1 man page for additional parameters you can pass to cpan
   on the command line.

Perl Module Dependencies

  Perl Modules which are only required by other modules

   The modules on the previous page are referenced from other pages in BLFS,
   but these modules are only in the book as dependencies of those modules.
   If you use the CPAN install method, you do not need to read this page.

   The BLFS editors pay much less attention to these modules, and the
   versions will not be regularly reviewed. In all cases, only the required
   or recommended dependencies are listed - there might be other modules
   which allow more tests to be run, but omitting them will still allow the
   tests to PASS.

  Note

   The links on this page (to metacpan.org) should go to "known good"
   versions, for which their dependencies are correct. If you wish to use a
   later version, please check the Changes file at https://metacpan.org -
   sometimes added dependencies are listed, other times not. Some of these
   modules have very frequent updates, often bringing different dependencies.
   The linked metacpan.org versions below are known to build and work with
   the module versions in BLFS-9.0.

   However, if you notice that the Changes file for a newer version than is
   in the current development book reports a fix for a security issue, please
   report this to either the blfs-dev or the blfs-support list.

   Similarly, if you discover that an updated module on the previous page
   needs an extra dependency, please report this.

  File::chdir-0.1010

    Introduction to File::chdir

   File::chdir provides a more sensible way to change directories.

   use calls chdir(), it changes the current working directory for the
   *whole* program. File::chdir gives you an alternative, $CWD and @CWD.

PHP-7.3.8

  Introduction to PHP

   PHP is the PHP Hypertext Preprocessor. Primarily used in dynamic web
   sites, it allows for programming code to be directly embedded into the
   HTML markup. It is also useful as a general purpose scripting language.

   This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS-9.0
   platform.

  Installation of PHP

   You can use PHP for server-side scripting, command-line scripting or
   client-side GUI applications. This book provides instructions for setting
   up PHP for server-side scripting as it is the most common form.

  Note

   PHP has many more configure options that will enable support for various
   things. You can use ./configure --help to see a full list of the available
   options. Also, use of the PHP web site is highly recommended, as their
   online docs are very good. An example of a configure command that utilizes
   many of the most common dependencies can be found at
   http://anduin.linuxfromscratch.org/BLFS/files/php_configure.txt.

   If, for whatever reason, you don't have libxml2-2.9.9 installed, you need
   to add --disable-libxml to the configure command in the instructions
   below. Note that this will prevent the pear command from being built.

   Install PHP by running the following commands:

 ./configure --prefix=/usr                \
             --sysconfdir=/etc            \
             --localstatedir=/var         \
             --datadir=/usr/share/php     \
             --mandir=/usr/share/man      \
             --without-pear               \
             --enable-fpm                 \
             --with-fpm-user=apache       \
             --with-fpm-group=apache      \
             --with-config-file-path=/etc \
             --with-zlib                  \
             --enable-bcmath              \
             --with-bz2                   \
             --enable-calendar            \
             --enable-dba=shared          \
             --with-gdbm                  \
             --with-gmp                   \
             --enable-ftp                 \
             --with-gettext               \
             --enable-mbstring            \
             --with-readline              &&
 make

   To test the results, issue: make test. A few tests may fail, in which case
   you are asked whether you want to send the report to the PHP developers.
   If you want to automate the test, you may prefix the command with yes "n"
   | .

   Now, as the root user:

 make install                                     &&
 install -v -m644 php.ini-production /etc/php.ini &&

 install -v -m755 -d /usr/share/doc/php-7.3.8 &&
 install -v -m644    CODING_STANDARDS EXTENSIONS INSTALL NEWS README* UPGRADING* php.gif \
                     /usr/share/doc/php-7.3.8 &&
 ln -v -sfn          /usr/lib/php/doc/Archive_Tar/docs/Archive_Tar.txt \
                     /usr/share/doc/php-7.3.8 &&
 ln -v -sfn          /usr/lib/php/doc/Structures_Graph/docs \
                     /usr/share/doc/php-7.3.8

   The default configuration files for the fastCGI process manager are
   installed only if they do not already exist on the system. If this is the
   first installation, they should be renamed, as the root user:

 if [ -f /etc/php-fpm.conf.default ]; then
   mv -v /etc/php-fpm.conf{.default,} &&
   mv -v /etc/php-fpm.d/www.conf{.default,}
 fi

   The pre-built HTML documentation is packaged in two forms: a tarball
   containing many individual files, useful for quick loading into your
   browser, and one large individual file, which is useful for using the
   search utility of your browser. If you downloaded either, or both, of the
   documentation files, issue the following commands as the root user to
   install them (note these instructions assume English docs, modify the
   tarball names below if necessary).

   For the âSingle HTMLâ file:

 install -v -m644 ../php_manual_en.html.gz \
     /usr/share/doc/php-7.3.8 &&
 gunzip -v /usr/share/doc/php-7.3.8/php_manual_en.html.gz

   For the âMany HTML filesâ tarball:

 tar -xvf ../php_manual_en.tar.gz \
     -C /usr/share/doc/php-7.3.8 --no-same-owner

   The bundled pear is not installed because of a bug which might pollute the
   filesystem with several hidden files and directories. If pear is needed,
   execute the following commands to install it:

 wget http://pear.php.net/go-pear.phar
 php ./go-pear.phar

  Command Explanations

   --datadir=/usr/share/php: This works around a bug in the build machinery,
   which installs some data to a wrong location.

   --enable-fpm: This parameter allows building the fastCGI Process Manager.

   --without-pear: This switch disables installation of bundled pear
   software.

   --with-config-file-path=/etc: This parameter makes PHP look for the
   php.ini configuration file in /etc.

   --with-zlib: This parameter adds support for Zlib compression.

   --enable-bcmath: Enables bc style precision math functions.

   --with-bz2: Adds support for Bzip2 compression functions.

   --enable-calendar: This parameter provides support for calendar
   conversion.

   --enable-dba=shared: This parameter enables support for database
   (dbm-style) abstraction layer functions.

   --enable-ftp: This parameter enables FTP functions.

   --with-gettext: Enables functions that use Gettext text translation.

   --enable-mbstring: This parameter enables multibyte string support.

   --with-readline: This parameter enables command line Readline support.

   --disable-libxml: This option allows building PHP without libxml2
   installed.

   --with-apxs2: Instead of building the fastCGI process manager, it is
   possible to build an apache module. This has some performance penalty for
   heavy loaded servers, but may be easier to set up. This switch is
   incompatible with the --enable-fpm and --with-fpm-... switches.

   --with-mysqli=shared: This option includes MySQLi support.

   --with-mysql-sock=/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock: Location of the MySQL unix
   socket pointer.

   --with-pdo-mysql=shared: This option includes PDO: MySQL support.

   --with-tidy=shared: This option includes tidy library support.

  Configuring PHP

    Config Files

   /etc/php.ini, /etc/pear.conf, /etc/php-fpm.conf, and
   /etc/php-fpm.d/www.conf

    Configuration Information

   The file used as the default /etc/php.ini configuration file is
   recommended by the PHP development team. This file modifies the default
   behavior of PHP. If no /etc/php.ini is used, all configuration settings
   fall to the defaults. You should review the comments in this file and
   ensure the changes are acceptable in your particular environment.

   The fastCGI process manager uses the configuration file /etc/php-fpm.conf.
   The default file shipped with PHP includes all the /etc/php-fpm.d/*.conf
   in turn. There is a shipped /etc/php-fpm.d/www.conf file, that contains
   the parameters related to the interaction with the Apache Web server.

   You may have noticed the following from the output of the make install
   command:

 You may want to add: /usr/lib/php to your php.ini include_path

   If desired, add the entry using the following command as the root user:

 sed -i 's@php/includes"@&\ninclude_path = ".:/usr/lib/php"@' \
     /etc/php.ini

   To enable fastCGI support in the Apache web server, two LoadModule
   directives must be added to the httpd.conf file. They are commented out,
   so just issue the following command as root user:

 sed -i -e '/proxy_module/s/^#//'      \
        -e '/proxy_fcgi_module/s/^#//' \
        /etc/httpd/httpd.conf

   Those modules accept various ProxyPass directives. One possibility is (as
   the root user):

 echo \
 'ProxyPassMatch ^/(.*\.php)$ fcgi://127.0.0.1:9000/srv/www/$1' >> \
 /etc/httpd/httpd.conf

   Additionally, it may be useful to add an entry for index.php to the
   DirectoryIndex directive of the httpd.conf file. Lastly, adding a line to
   setup the .phps extension to show highlighted PHP source may be desirable:

 AddType application/x-httpd-php-source .phps

   You'll need to restart the Apache web server after making any
   modifications to the httpd.conf file.

    Boot Script

   To automatically start the php-fpm daemon when the system is rebooted,
   install the /etc/rc.d/init.d/php bootscript from the
   blfs-bootscripts-20190609 package as the root user:

 make install-php

  Contents

   Installed Programs: pear, peardev, pecl, phar (symlink), phar.phar, php,
   php-cgi, php-config, php-fpm, phpdbg, and phpize
   Installed Libraries: dba.{so,a} and opcache.{so,a} in
   /usr/lib/php/extensions/no-debug-non-zts-20180731
   Installed Directories: /etc/php-fpm.d, /usr/{include,lib,share}/php and
   /usr/share/doc/php-7.3.8

    Short Descriptions

   php     is a command line interface that enables you to parse and execute  
           PHP code.                                                          
   pear    is the PHP Extension and Application Repository (PEAR) package     
           manager. This isn't installed by default.                          
   php-fpm is the fastCGI process manager for PHP.                            
   phpdbg  is the interactive PHP debugger.

Python-2.7.16

  Introduction to Python 2

   The Python 2 package contains the Python development environment. It is
   useful for object-oriented programming, writing scripts, prototyping large
   programs or developing entire applications. This version is for backward
   compatibility with other dependent packages.

  Note

   Python2 has been deprecated by the upstream developers. Support for
   Python2 will be discontinued on January 1st, 2020.

   BLFS is attempting to use Python3 as much as possible, but some packages
   have not been updated to support Python3.

   This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS-9.0
   platform.

   User Notes: http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/Python

  Installation of Python 2

  Caution

   If updating pip2 with the command pip2 install --upgrade pip, it will
   remove pip3 and the symlink pip installed in LFS. To restore pip and pip3,
   run, as the root user:

 python3 -m pip install --force pip

   Install Python 2 by running the following commands:

 ./configure --prefix=/usr       \
             --enable-shared     \
             --with-system-expat \
             --with-system-ffi   \
             --with-ensurepip=yes \
             --enable-unicode=ucs4 &&
 make

   To test the results, issue: make -k test. Three tests fail for unknown
   reasons.

   Now, as the root user:

 make install &&
 chmod -v 755 /usr/lib/libpython2.7.so.1.0

   Since Python 2 is in maintenance mode, and Python 3 is recommended by
   upstream for development, you probably do not need to install the
   documentation. However, if you still want to install documentation for
   both Python versions, be sure to define the PYTHONDOCS variable for the
   version you want to use, each time you need to consult the documentation.
   If you have downloaded the preformatted documentation from
   http://docs.python.org/download.html, install it as the root user:

 install -v -dm755 /usr/share/doc/python-2.7.16 &&

 tar --strip-components=1                     \
     --no-same-owner                          \
     --directory /usr/share/doc/python-2.7.16 \
     -xvf ../python-2.7.16-docs-html.tar.bz2 &&

 find /usr/share/doc/python-2.7.16 -type d -exec chmod 0755 {} \; &&
 find /usr/share/doc/python-2.7.16 -type f -exec chmod 0644 {} \;

  Command Explanations

   --with-system-expat: This switch enables linking against system version of
   Expat.

   --with-system-ffi: This switch enables linking against system version of
   libffi.

   --with-ensurepip=yes : This switch enables building pip and setuptools
   packaging programs. setuptools is needed for building some Python modules.

   --enable-unicode=ucs4: This switch enables 32bit Unicode support in
   Python.

   --with-dbmliborder=bdb:gdbm:ndbm: Use this switch if you want to build
   Python DBM Module against Berkeley DB instead of GDBM.

   chmod ...: Fix permissions for libraries to be consistent with other
   libraries.

  Configuring Python 2

   In order for python to find the installed documentation, you must add the
   following environment variable to individual user's or the system's
   profile:

 export PYTHONDOCS=/usr/share/doc/python-2.7.16

  Contents

   Installed Programs: 2to3, pip2, pydoc, python (symlink), python-config

   Installed Library: libpython2.7.so
   Installed Directories: /usr/{include,lib}/python2.7 and
   /usr/share/doc/python-2.7.16

    Short Descriptions

   2to3      is a Python program that reads Python 2.x source code and        
             applies a series of fixes to transform it into valid Python 3.x  
             code.                                                            
   pip2      is the package manager for Python 2.x. It is used to automate    
             management of Python 2.x modules.                                
   idle      is a wrapper script that opens a Python aware GUI editor. For    
             this script to run, you must have installed Tk before Python so  
             that the Tkinter Python module is built.

Python-3.7.4

  Introduction to Python 3

   The Python 3 package contains the Python development environment. This is
   useful for object-oriented programming, writing scripts, prototyping large
   programs or developing entire applications.

  Note

   Python 3 was installed in LFS. The only reason to rebuild it here is if
   optional modules are needed.

   This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS-9.0
   platform.

    Package Information

     * Download (HTTP):
       https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.7.4/Python-3.7.4.tar.xz

     * Download MD5 sum: d33e4aae66097051c2eca45ee3604803

     * Download size: 16 MB

     * Estimated disk space required: 180 MB (add 22 MB for tests)

     * Estimated build time: 1.0 SBU (add 1.1 SBU for tests)

    Python 3 Dependencies

      Optional

   BlueZ-5.50, GDB-8.3 (required for some tests), Valgrind-3.15.0, and
   libmpcdec

      Optional (For Additional Modules)

   Berkeley DB-5.3.28, SQLite-3.29.0, and Tk-8.6.9

   User Notes: http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/Python3

  Installation of Python 3

   Install Python 3 by running the following commands:

 CXX="/usr/bin/g++"              \
 ./configure --prefix=/usr       \
             --enable-shared     \
             --with-system-expat \
             --with-system-ffi   \
             --with-ensurepip=yes &&
 make

   The test suite must be run separately, using an X terminal (see below).

   Now, as the root user:

 make install &&
 chmod -v 755 /usr/lib/libpython3.7m.so &&
 chmod -v 755 /usr/lib/libpython3.so

   The test suite must be run separately from the build, either before or
   after the package is built and installed. Do not run make install after
   running the test suite. To build and install the package, you need to
   start with a fresh or clean source tree. For the tests, you also need a
   clean source code, so either start by removing the source code directory
   and starting over, by uncompressing the source tarball or by running make
   clean. Then configure again, adding â--with-pydebugâ to the configure
   switches above, run make, then make test. Remember that tests must be
   executed using an X terminal. The test SBU highly depends on the speed of
   the internet connection.

  Command Explanations

   CXX="/usr/bin/g++" ./configure ...: Avoid an annoying message during
   configuration.

   --with-system-expat: This switch enables linking against the system
   version of Expat.

   --with-system-ffi: This switch enables linking against system version of
   libffi.

   --with-ensurepip=yes : This switch enables building pip and setuptools
   packaging programs. setuptools is needed for building some Python modules.

   --with-dbmliborder=bdb:gdbm:ndbm: Use this switch if you want to build
   Python DBM Module against Berkeley DB instead of GDBM.

   --enable-optimization: Use this switch if you want to enable expensive
   optimizations (i.e. Profile Guided Optimizations). This adds around 20
   SBU, but can slightly speed up some uses, such as using Sphinx for
   creating documentation, or use of Python3 scripts.

   --with-lto: This optional switch enables thick Link Time Optimization.
   Unusually, it creates a much larger
   /usr/lib/python3.7/config-3.7m-x86_64-linux-gnu/libpython3.7m.a with a
   small increase in the time to compile Python. Run-time results do not
   appear to show any benefit from doing this.

   chmod ...: Fix permissions for shared libraries to be consistent with
   other libraries.

  Configuring Python 3

   In order for python3 to find the installed documentation, create the
   following version independent symlink:

 ln -svfn python-3.7.4 /usr/share/doc/python-3

   and add the following environment variable to the individual user's or
   system's profile:

 export PYTHONDOCS=/usr/share/doc/python-3/html

  Contents

   Installed Programs: 2to3 (symlink), 2to3-3.7, idle3 (symlink), and idle3.7
   pydoc3 (symlink), pydoc3.7, python3 (symlink); python3.7 and python3.7m
   (hardlinked); python3-config (symlink), python3.7-config (symlink),
   python3.7m-config, pyvenv (symlink), pyvenv-3.7,
   Installed Libraries: libpython3.7m.so and libpython3.so
   Installed Directories: /usr/include/python3.7m, /usr/lib/python3.7, and
   /usr/share/doc/python-3.7.4

    Short Descriptions

   idle3     is a wrapper script that opens a Python aware GUI editor. For

Rustc-1.35.0

  Introduction to Rust

   The Rust programming language is designed to be a safe, concurrent,
   practical language.

   This package is updated on a six-weekly release cycle. Because it is such
   a large and slow package to build, and is at the moment only required by a
   few packages in this book, the BLFS editors take the view that it should
   only be updated when that is necessary (either to fix problems, or to
   allow a new version of firefox to build).

   As with many other programming languages, rustc (the rust compiler) needs
   a binary from which to bootstrap. It will download a stage0 binary and
   many cargo crates (these are actually .tar.gz source archives) at the
   start of the build, so you cannot compile it without an internet
   connection.

   These crates will then remain in various forms (cache, directories of
   extracted source), in ~/.cargo for ever more. It is common for large rust
   packages to use multiple versions of some crates. If you purge the files
   before updating this package, very few crates will need to be updated by
   the packages in this book which use it (and they will be downloaded as
   required). But if you retain an older version as a fallback option and
   then use it (when not building in /usr), it is likely that it will then
   have to re-download some crates. For a full download (i.e. starting with
   an empty or missing ~/.cargo) downloading the external cargo files for
   this version only takes a minute or so on a fast network.

  Note

   Although BLFS usually installs in /usr, when you later upgrade to a newer
   version of rust the old libraries in /usr/lib/rustlib will remain, with
   various hashes in their names, but will not be usable and will waste
   space. The editors recommend placing the files in the /opt directory. In
   particular, if you have reason to rebuild with a modified configuration
   (e.g. using the shipped LLVM after building with shared LLVM, but perhaps
   also the reverse situation) it it possible for the install to leave a
   broken cargo program. In such a situation, either remove the existing
   installation first, or use a different prefix such as
   /opt/rustc-1.35.0-build2.

   If you prefer, you can of course change the prefix to /usr and omit the
   ldconfig and the actions to add rustc to the PATH.

   The current rustbuild build-system will use all available processors,
   although it does not scale well and often falls back to just using one
   core while waiting for a library to compile.

   At the moment Rust does not provide any guarantees of a stable ABI.

  Note

   Rustc defaults to building for ALL supported architectures, using a
   shipped copy of LLVM. In BLFS the build is only for the X86 architecture.
   Rustc still claims to require Python 2, but that is only really necessary
   when building some other architectures with the shipped LLVM. If you
   intend to develop rust crates, this build may not be good enough for your
   purposes.

   The build times of this version when repeated on the same machine are
   often reasonably consistent, but as with all compilations using rustc
   there can be some very slow outliers.

   Unusually, a DESTDIR-style method is being used to install this package.
   This is because running the install as root not only downloads all of the
   cargo files again (to /root/.cargo), it then spends a very long time
   recompiling. Using this method saves a lot of time, at the cost of extra
   disk space.

   This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS-9.0
   platform.

   by the testsuite)

   User Notes: http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/rust

  Installation of Rust

   To install into the /opt directory, remove the symlink and create a new
   directory (i.e. with a different name if trying a modified build). As the
   root user:

 mkdir /opt/rustc-1.35.0             &&
 ln -svfin rustc-1.35.0 /opt/rustc

  Note

   If multiple versions of Rust are installed in /opt, changing to another
   version only requires changing the /opt/rustc symbolic link and then
   running ldconfig.

   Create a suitable config.toml file which will configure the build.

 cat << EOF > config.toml
 # see config.toml.example for more possible options
 # See the 8.4 book for an example using shipped LLVM
 # e.g. if not installing clang, or using a version before 8.0.
 [llvm]
 # by default, rust will build for a myriad of architectures
 targets = "X86"

 # When using system llvm prefer shared libraries
 link-shared = true

 [build]
 # omit docs to save time and space (default is to build them)
 docs = false

 # install cargo as well as rust
 extended = true

 [install]
 prefix = "/opt/rustc-1.35.0"
 docdir = "share/doc/rustc-1.35.0"

 [rust]
 channel = "stable"
 rpath = false

 # BLFS does not install the FileCheck executable from llvm,
 # so disable codegen tests
 codegen-tests = false

 [target.x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu]
 # NB the output of llvm-config (i.e. help options) may be
 # dumped to the screen when config.toml is parsed.
 llvm-config = "/usr/bin/llvm-config"

 [target.i686-unknown-linux-gnu]
 # NB the output of llvm-config (i.e. help options) may be
 # dumped to the screen when config.toml is parsed.
 llvm-config = "/usr/bin/llvm-config"

 EOF

   Now compile Rust by running the following commands:

 export RUSTFLAGS="$RUSTFLAGS -C link-args=-lffi" &&
 python3 ./x.py build --exclude src/tools/miri

  Note

   The testsuite will generate some messages in the system log for traps on
   invalid opcodes, and for segmentation faults. In themselves these are
   nothing to worry about, just a way for the test to be terminated.

   To run the tests issue python3 ./x.py test --verbose --no-fail-fast | tee
   rustc-testlog: as with the build, that will use all available CPUs.

   The instructions above do not build ARM compilers, so the testsuite will
   fail and the tests will be reported to end in error, with a backtrace of
   the last failing test. On a good run, 3 tests which need Thumb (ARM)
   compilers will fail, all in ui/issues for issues 37131, 49851 and 50993. A
   fourth test, run-make-fulldeps/sysroot-crates-are-unstable fails,
   presumably because we are using only stable features. If gdb has been
   installed, in some circumstances tests in debuginfo may fail. As with all
   large testsuites, other tests might fail on some machines - if the number
   of failures is in the single digits, check the log for 'FAILED' and review
   lines above that, particularly the 'stderr:' lines. Any mention of SIGSEGV
   or signal 11 in a failing test is a cause for concern.

   Therefore, you should determine the number of tests, failures, etc. The
   total number of tests which were considered is found by running:

 grep 'running .* tests' rustc-testlog | awk '{ sum += $2 } END { print sum }'

   That should report 16499 tests. Similarly, the total tests which failed
   can be found by running:

 grep '^test result:' rustc-testlog | awk  '{ sum += $6 } END { print sum }'

   And similarly for the tests which passed use $4, for those which were
   ignored (i.e. skipped) use $8 (and $10 for 'measured', $12 for 'filtered
   out' but both are probably zero). The breakdown does not quite match the
   overall total.

   Still as your normal user, do a DESTDIR install:

 export LIBSSH2_SYS_USE_PKG_CONFIG=1 &&
 DESTDIR=${PWD}/install python3 ./x.py install &&
 unset LIBSSH2_SYS_USE_PKG_CONFIG

   Now, as the root user install the files from the DESTDIR:

 chown -R root:root install &&
 cp -a install/* /

  Command Explanations

   ln -svfn rustc-1.35.0 /opt/rustc: if this is not the first use of the
   /opt/rustc symlink, overwrite it by forcing, and use the '-n' flag to
   avoid getting confusing results from e.g. ls -l.

   targets = "X86": this avoids building all the available linux
   cross-compilers (Aarch64, MIPS, PowerPC, SystemZ, etc). Unfortunately,
   rust insists on installing source files for these below
   /opt/rustc/lib/src.

   extended = true: this installs Cargo alongside Rust.

   channel = "stable": this ensures only stable features can be used, the
   default in config.toml is to use development features, which is not
   appropriate for a released version.

   rpath = false: by default, rust can be run from where it was built,
   without being installed. That adds DT_RPATH entries to all of the ELF
   files, which produces very messy output from ldd, showing the libraries in
   the place they were built, even if they have been deleted from there after
   the install.

   export RUSTFLAGS="$RUSTFLAGS -C link-args=-lffi": This adds a link to
   libffi to any RUSTFLAGS you may already be passing to the build. On some
   systems, linking fails to include libffi unless this is used. The reason
   why this is needed is not clear.

   --exclude src/tools/miri: For a long time, the miri crate (an interpreter
   for the Midlevel Intermediate Representation) has failed to build on
   releases. It is optional, but the failure messages can persuade people
   that the whole build failed. However, although it is not built in the main
   compile, with rustc-1.35.0 it now gets compiled during the install, but it
   is broken in this version.

   --verbose: this switch can sometimes provide more information about a test
   which fails.

   --no-fail-fast: this switch ensures that the testsuite will not stop at
   the first error.

   export LIBSSH2_SYS_USE_PKG_CONFIG=1: On some systems, cairo fails to link
   during the install because it cannot find libssh2. This seems to fix it,
   but again the reason why the problem occurs is not understood.

   DESTDIR=${PWD}/install python3 ./x.py install: This effects a
   DESTDIR-style install in the source tree,creating an install directory.
   Note that DESTDIR installs need an absolute path, passing 'install' will
   not work.

   chown -R root:root install: the DESTDIR install was run by a regular user,
   who owns the files. For security, change their owner before doing a simple
   copy to install them.

  Configuring Rust

    Configuration Information

   If you installed rustc in /opt, you need to update the following
   configuration files so that rustc is correctly found by other packages and
   system processes.

   As the root user, update the /etc/ld.so.conf file and the dynamic linker's
   run-time cache file:

 cat >> /etc/ld.so.conf << EOF
 # Begin rustc addition

 /opt/rustc/lib

 # End rustc addition
 EOF

 ldconfig

   As the root user, create the /etc/profile.d/rustc.sh file:

 cat > /etc/profile.d/rustc.sh << "EOF"
 # Begin /etc/profile.d/rustc.sh

 pathprepend /opt/rustc/bin           PATH

 # End /etc/profile.d/rustc.sh
 EOF

   Immediately after installation, update the current PATH for your current
   shell as a normal user:

 source /etc/profile.d/rustc.sh

  Introduction to Subversion

   Subversion is a version control system that is designed to be a compelling
   replacement for CVS in the open source community. It extends and enhances
   CVS' feature set, while maintaining a similar interface for those already
   familiar with CVS. These instructions install the client and server
   software used to manipulate a Subversion repository. Creation of a
   repository is covered at Running a Subversion Server.

   This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS-9.0
   platform.

       bindings, 30 SBU for tests)

    Subversion Dependencies

      Required

   Apr-Util-1.6.1 and SQLite-3.29.0

      Recommended

   Serf-1.3.9 (for handling http:// and https:// URLs)

      Optional

   Apache-2.4.41, Cyrus SASL-2.1.27, dbus-1.12.16, libsecret-0.18.8,
   Python-2.7.16 (with sqlite support for the tests), Ruby-2.6.4, SWIG-4.0.0
   (for building Perl, Python and Ruby bindings), LZ4, and UTF8proc

      Optional (for the Java Bindings)

   One of OpenJDK-12.0.2, Dante or Jikes, and JUnit 4 (to test the Java
   bindings). Note that JUnit is included with apache-ant-1.10.6.

   User Notes: http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/subversion

  Installation of Subversion

  Note

   This package may fail during the make phase when using multiple
   processors. If this occurs try continuing with make -j1 or redo the entire
   build process with fresh sources using -j1.

   First, apply a fix to adapt subversion to SWIG-4.0.0:

 sed -i 's/classic/nofastunpack/' build.conf

   Install Subversion by running the following commands:

 ./configure --prefix=/usr             \
             --disable-static          \
             --with-apache-libexecdir  \
             --with-lz4=internal       \
             --with-utf8proc=internal &&
 make

   If you have Doxygen-1.8.16 installed and you wish to build the API
   documentation, issue:

 doxygen doc/doxygen.conf

   If you passed the --enable-javahl parameter to configure and wish to build
   the Java bindings, issue the following command:

 make javahl

   If you want to compile Perl, Python2, or Ruby bindings, issue any of the
   following command:

 make swig-pl # for Perl
 make swig-py \
      swig_pydir=/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/libsvn \
      swig_pydir_extra=/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/svn # for Python
 make swig-rb # for Ruby

   To test the results, issue: make check. The upgrade_tests.py test is known
   to fail.

   To test the results of the Java bindings build, issue make check-javahl.
   The JUnit testing framework must be installed, and the location of the
   JUnit jar has to be specified by passing the --with-junit=<path to junit
   jar> parameter to configure. Note that JUnit is included in
   apache-ant-1.10.6, and can be accessed by passing
   --with-junit=/opt/ant/lib/junit-4.12.jar to configure.

   To test the results of any of the SWIG bindings, you can use any of the
   following commands: make check-swig-pl, make check-swig-py, or make
   check-swig-rb.

   Now, as the root user:

 make install &&

 install -v -m755 -d /usr/share/doc/subversion-1.12.2 &&
 cp      -v -R doc/* /usr/share/doc/subversion-1.12.2

   If you built the Java bindings, issue the following command as the root
   user to install them:

 make install-javahl

   If you built the Perl, Python2, or Ruby bindings, issue any of the
   following commands as the root user to install them:

 make install-swig-pl
 make install-swig-py \
       swig_pydir=/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/libsvn \
       swig_pydir_extra=/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/svn
 make install-swig-rb

  Command Explanations

   --disable-static: This switch prevents installation of static versions of
   the libraries.

   --with-apache-libexecdir: If Apache-2.4.41 is installed, the shared Apache
   modules are built. This switch allows to have those modules installed to
   Apache's configured module dir instead of /usr/libexec. It has no effect
   if Apache is not installed.

   --with-lz4=internal, --with-utf8proc=internal: Remove them if you have
   installed the optional dependencies.

   --enable-javahl: enables compilation of Java high level bindings. Running
   make javahl is necessary to do the compilation.

   --with-junit=<location of the junit jar file>: gives the location of the
   junit jar, otherwise the javahl tests cannot be run.

   --disable-gmock: Do not use the Googlemock testing framework.

Running a Subversion Server

  Running a Subversion Server

   This section will describe how to set up, administer and secure a
   Subversion server.

    Subversion Server Dependencies

      Required

   Subversion-1.12.2 and OpenSSH-8.0p1

  Setting up a Subversion Server.

   The following instructions will install a Subversion server, which will be
   set up to use OpenSSH as the secure remote access method, with svnserve
   available for anonymous access.

   Configuration of the Subversion server consists of the following steps:

    1. Setup Users, Groups, and Permissions

   You'll need to be user root for the initial portion of configuration.
   Create the svn user and group with the following commands:

 groupadd -g 56 svn &&
 useradd -c "SVN Owner" -d /home/svn -m -g svn -s /bin/false -u 56 svn

   If you plan to have multiple repositories, you should have a group
   dedicated to each repository for ease of administration. Create the
   svntest group for the test repository and add the svn user to that group
   with the following commands:

 groupadd -g 57 svntest &&
 usermod -G svntest -a svn

   Additionally you should set umask 002 while working with a repository so
   that all new files will be writable by owner and group. This is made
   mandatory by creating a wrapper script for svn and svnserve:

 mv /usr/bin/svn /usr/bin/svn.orig &&
 mv /usr/bin/svnserve /usr/bin/svnserve.orig &&
 cat >> /usr/bin/svn << "EOF"
 #!/bin/sh
 umask 002
 /usr/bin/svn.orig "$@"
 EOF
 cat >> /usr/bin/svnserve << "EOF"
 #!/bin/sh
 umask 002
 /usr/bin/svnserve.orig "$@"
 EOF
 chmod 0755 /usr/bin/svn{,serve}

  Note

   If you use Apache for working with the repository over HTTP, even for
   anonymous access, you should wrap /usr/sbin/httpd in a similar script.

    2. Create a Subversion repository.

   There are several ways to set up a subversion repository. It is
   recommended to have a look at the SVN Book corresponding chapter. A basic
   repository can be set up with the instructions below.

   Create a new Subversion repository with the following commands (as the
   root user):

 install -v -m 0755 -d /srv/svn &&
 install -v -m 0755 -o svn -g svn -d /srv/svn/repositories &&
 svnadmin create /srv/svn/repositories/svntest

   Now that the repository is created, it should be populated with something
   useful. You'll need to have a predefined directory layout set up exactly
   as you want your repository to look. For example, here is a sample BLFS
   layout setup with a root of svntest/. You'll need to setup a directory
   tree similar to the following:

 svntest/            # The name of the repository
    trunk/           # Contains the existing source tree
       BOOK/
       bootscripts/
       edguide/
       patches/
       scripts/
    branches/        # Needed for additional branches
    tags/            # Needed for tagging release points

   Once you've created your directory layout as shown above, you are ready to
   do the initial import:

 svn import -m "Initial import." \
     </path/to/source/tree>      \
     file:///srv/svn/repositories/svntest

   Now change owner and group information on the repository, and add an
   unprivileged user to the svn and svntest groups:

 chown -R svn:svntest /srv/svn/repositories/svntest    &&
 chmod -R g+w         /srv/svn/repositories/svntest    &&
 chmod g+s            /srv/svn/repositories/svntest/db &&
 usermod -G svn,svntest -a <username>

   svntest is the group assigned to the svntest repository. As mentioned
   earlier, this eases administration of multiple repositories when using
   OpenSSH for authentication. Going forward, you'll need to add your
   unprivileged user, and any additional users that you wish to have write
   access to the repository, to the svn and svntest groups.

   In addition, you'll notice that the new repository's db directory is
   set-groupID. If the reasoning is not immediately obvious, when using any
   external authentication method (such as ssh), the sticky bit is set so
   that all new files will be owned by the user, but group of svntest. Anyone
   in the svntest group can create files, but still give the entire group
   write access to those files. This avoids locking out other users from the
   repository.

   Now, return to an unprivileged user account, and take a look at the new
   repository using svnlook:

 svnlook tree /srv/svn/repositories/svntest/

  Note

   You may need to log out and back in again to refresh your group
   memberships. 'su <username>' should work as well.

    3. Configure the Server

   As mentioned previously, these instructions will configure the server to
   use only ssh for write access to the repository and to provide anonymous
   access using svnserve. There are several other ways to provide access to
   the repository. These additional configurations are best explained at
   http://svnbook.red-bean.com/.

   Access configuration needs to be done for each repository. Create the
   svnserve.conf file for the svntest repository using the following
   commands:

 cp /srv/svn/repositories/svntest/conf/svnserve.conf \
    /srv/svn/repositories/svntest/conf/svnserve.conf.default &&

 cat > /srv/svn/repositories/svntest/conf/svnserve.conf << "EOF"
 [general]
 anon-access = read
 auth-access = write
 EOF

   There is not a lot to the configuration file at all. You'll notice that
   only the general section is required. Take a look at the
   svnserve.conf.default file for information on using svnserve's built-in
   authentication method.

    4. Starting the Server

   To start the server at boot time, install the svn bootscript included in
   the blfs-bootscripts-20190609 package.

 make install-svn

SWIG-4.0.0

  Introduction to SWIG

   SWIG (Simplified Wrapper and Interface Generator) is a compiler that
   integrates C and C++ with languages including Perl, Python, Tcl, Ruby,
   PHP, Java, C#, D, Go, Lua, Octave, R, Scheme, and Ocaml. SWIG can also
   export its parse tree into Lisp s-expressions and XML.

   SWIG reads annotated C/C++ header files and creates wrapper code (glue
   code) in order to make the corresponding C/C++ libraries available to the
   listed languages, or to extend C/C++ programs with a scripting language.

   This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS-9.0
   platform.

    Package Information

     * Download (HTTP):
       https://downloads.sourceforge.net/swig/swig-4.0.0.tar.gz

     * Download MD5 sum: 572074323f49d9cb14460d986f87230a

     * Download size: 7.7 MB

     * Estimated disk space required: 161 MB (1.3 GB with tests)

     * Estimated build time: 0.2 SBU (add 14 SBU for tests; both using
       parallelism=4)

    SWIG Dependencies

      Required

   PCRE-8.43

      Optional

   Boost-1.70.0 for tests, and any of the languages mentioned in the
   introduction, as run-time dependencies

   User Notes: http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/swig

  Installation of SWIG

   Install SWIG by running the following commands:

 ./configure --prefix=/usr \
             --without-maximum-compile-warnings &&
 make

   To test the results, issue: make -k check TCL_INCLUDE=. The unsetting of
   the variable TCL_INCLUDE is necessary since it is not correctly set by
   configure. The tests are only executed for the languages installed on your
   machine, so the disk space and SBU values given for the tests may vary,
   and should be considered as mere orders of magnitude. If you have
   Python-2.7.16 installed, the Python-3 tests are not run. You can run tests
   for Python-3 by issuing PY3=1 make check-python-examples followed by PY3=1
   make check-python-test-suite. According to SWIG's documentation, the
   failure of some tests should not be considered harmful.

   Now, as the root user:

 make install &&
 install -v -m755 -d /usr/share/doc/swig-4.0.0 &&
 cp -v -R Doc/* /usr/share/doc/swig-4.0.0

  Command Explanations

   --without-maximum-compile-warnings: disables compiler ansi conformance
   enforcement, which triggers errors in the Lua headers (starting with Lua
   5.3).

   --without-<language>: allows disabling the building of tests and examples
   for <language>, but all the languages capabilities of SWIG are always
   built.

  Contents

   Installed Programs: swig and ccache-swig
   Installed Library: None
   Installed Directories: /usr/share/doc/swig-4.0.0 and /usr/share/swig

    Short Descriptions

   swig        takes an interface file containing C/C++ declarations and SWIG 
               special instructions, and generates the corresponding wrapper  
               code needed to build extension modules.                        
   ccache-swig is a compiler cache, which speeds up re-compilation of         
               C/C++/SWIG code.

  Installation of Tcl

   This package is also installed in LFS during the bootstrap phase. As it is
   not installed during Chapter 6 of LFS, installation instructions are
   included here in BLFS.

   If you downloaded the optional documentation, unpack the tarball by
   issuing the following command:

 tar -xf ../tcl8.6.9-html.tar.gz --strip-components=1

   Install Tcl by running the following commands:

 export SRCDIR=`pwd` &&

 cd unix &&

 ./configure --prefix=/usr           \
             --mandir=/usr/share/man \
             $([ $(uname -m) = x86_64 ] && echo --enable-64bit) &&
 make &&

 sed -e "s#$SRCDIR/unix#/usr/lib#" \
     -e "s#$SRCDIR#/usr/include#"  \
     -i tclConfig.sh               &&

  Command Explanations

   $([ $(uname -m) = x86_64 ] && echo --enable-64bit): This switch is used to
   enable 64 bit support in Tcl on 64 bit operating systems.

   make install-private-headers: This command is used to install the Tcl
   library interface headers used by other packages if they link to the Tcl
   library.

   ln -v -sf tclsh8.6 /usr/bin/tclsh: This command is used to create a
   compatibility symbolic link to the tclsh8.6 file as many packages expect a
   file named tclsh.

   sed -e ...: The Tcl package expects that its source tree is preserved so
   that packages depending on it for their compilation can utilize it. These
   sed remove the references to the build directory and replace them with
   saner system-wide locations.

Valgrind-3.15.0

  Introduction to Valgrind

   Valgrind is an instrumentation framework for building dynamic analysis
   tools. There are Valgrind tools that can automatically detect many memory
   management and threading bugs, and profile programs in detail. Valgrind
   can also be used to build new tools.

   This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS-9.0
   platform.

     * Estimated build time: 0.6 SBU (Using parallelism=4; add 11 SBU for
       tests)

    Valgrind Dependencies

      Optional

   BIND-9.14.5 or BIND Utilities-9.14.5 (for tests), Boost-1.70.0, GDB-8.3
   (for tests), LLVM-8.0.1 (with Clang), and Which-2.21 (for tests)

   User Notes: http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/valgrind

  Installation of Valgrind

   Install Valgrind by running the following commands:

 sed -i 's|/doc/valgrind||' docs/Makefile.in &&

 ./configure --prefix=/usr \
             --datadir=/usr/share/doc/valgrind-3.15.0 &&
 make

   To test the results, issue: make regtest. The tests may hang forever if
   GDB-8.3 is not installed. Some tests are known to hang also, depending on
   the version of glibc. Problematic tests can be disabled by changing the
   prereq: line in the corresponding .vgtest file to prereq: false. For
   example:

 sed -e 's@prereq:.*@prereq: false@' \
     -i {helgrind,drd}/tests/pth_cond_destroy_busy.vgtest

  Note

   The OpenMP tests are skipped if libgomp has been compiled with
   --enable-linux-futex (the default). If needed, just recompile the libgomp
   library from the gcc build tree, passing --disable-linux-futex to
   configure, storing the library to some place and changing the link from
   /usr/lib/libgomp.so.1 to point to the new library.

   Now, as the root user:

 make install

  Command Explanations

   sed -i ... docs/Makefile.in : This sed provides for installing the
   documentation in a versioned directory.

   --enable-lto=yes: This option allows building Valgrind with LTO (link time
   optimization). This produces a smaller/faster Valgrind (up to 10%), but
   build time increases to about 5.5 SBU.

Other Programming Tools

  Introduction

   This section is provided to show you some additional programming tools for
   which instructions have not yet been created in the book or for those that
   are not appropriate for the book. Note that these packages may not have
   been tested by the BLFS team, but their mention here is meant to be a
   convenient source of additional information.

  Programming Frameworks, Languages and Compilers

    A+

   A+ is a powerful and efficient programming language. It is freely
   available under the GNU General Public License. It embodies a rich set of
   functions and operators, a modern graphical user interface with many
   widgets and automatic synchronization of widgets and variables,
   asynchronous execution of functions associated with variables and events,
   dynamic loading of user compiled subroutines, and many other features.
   Execution is by a rather efficient interpreter. A+ was created at Morgan
   Stanley. Primarily used in a computationally-intensive business
   environment, many critical applications written in A+ have withstood the
   demands of real world developers over many years. Written in an
   interpreted language, A+ applications tend to be portable.

    ABC

   ABC is an interactive programming language and environment for personal
   computing, originally intended as a good replacement for BASIC. It was
   designed by first doing a task analysis of the programming task. ABC is
   easy to learn (an hour or so for someone who has already programmed), and
   yet easy to use. Originally intended as a language for beginners, it has
   evolved into a powerful tool for beginners and experts alike. Some
   features of the language include: a powerful collection of only five data
   types that easily combines strong typing, yet without declarations, no
   limitations (such as max int), apart from sheer exhaustion of memory
   refinements to support top-down programming, nesting by indentation and
   programs typically are one fourth or one fifth the size of the equivalent
   Pascal or C program.

    ALF

   ALF is a language which combines functional and logic programming
   techniques. The foundation of ALF is Horn clause logic with equality which
   consists of predicates and Horn clauses for logic programming, and
   functions and equations for functional programming. The ALF system is an
   efficient implementation of the combination of resolution, narrowing,
   rewriting and rejection. Similarly to Prolog, ALF uses a backtracking
   strategy corresponding to a depth-first search in the derivation tree.

    ASM

   ASM is a Java bytecode manipulation framework. It can be used to
   dynamically generate stub classes or other proxy classes, directly in
   binary form, or to dynamically modify classes at load time, i.e., just
   before they are loaded into the Java Virtual Machine. ASM offers similar
   functionalities as BCEL or SERP, but is much smaller (33KB instead of
   350KB for BCEL and 150KB for SERP) and faster than these tools (the
   overhead of a load time class transformation is of the order of 60% with
   ASM, 700% or more with BCEL, and 1100% or more with SERP). Indeed ASM was
   designed to be used in a dynamic way (though it works statically as well)
   and was therefore designed and implemented to be as small and as fast as
   possible.

    BETA

   BETA is developed within the Scandinavian School of object-orientation,
   where the first object-oriented language, Simula, was developed. BETA is a
   modern language in the Simula tradition. The resulting language is smaller
   than Simula in spite of being considerably more expressive. BETA is a
   strongly typed language like Simula, Eiffel and C++, with most type
   checking being carried out at compile-time. It is well known that it is
   not possible to obtain all type checking at compile time without
   sacrificing the expressiveness of the language. BETA has optimum balance
   between compile-time type checking and run-time type checking.

    <bigwig>

   <bigwig> is a high-level programming language for developing interactive
   Web services. Programs are compiled into a conglomerate of lower-level
   technologies such as C code, HTTP, HTML, JavaScript, and SSL, all running
   on top of a runtime system based on an Apache Web server module. It is a
   descendant of the Mawl project but is a completely new design and
   implementation with vastly expanded ambitions. The <bigwig> language is
   really a collection of tiny domain-specific languages focusing on
   different aspects of interactive Web services. These contributing
   languages are held together by a C-like skeleton language. Thus, <bigwig>
   has the look and feel of C-programs but with special data and control
   structures.

    Clean

   Clean is a general purpose, state-of-the-art, pure and lazy functional
   programming language designed for making real-world applications. Clean is
   the only functional language in the world which offers uniqueness typing.
   This type system makes it possible in a pure functional language to
   incorporate destructive updates of arbitrary data structures (including
   arrays) and to make direct interfaces to the outside imperative world. The
   type system makes it possible to develop efficient applications.

    Cyclone

   Cyclone is a programming language based on C that is safe, meaning that it
   rules out programs that have buffer overflows, dangling pointers, format
   string attacks, and so on. High-level, type-safe languages, such as Java,
   Scheme, or ML also provide safety, but they don't give the same control
   over data representations and memory management that C does (witness the
   fact that the run-time systems for these languages are usually written in
   C.) Furthermore, porting legacy C code to these languages or interfacing
   with legacy C libraries is a difficult and error-prone process. The goal
   of Cyclone is to give programmers the same low-level control and
   performance of C without sacrificing safety, and to make it easy to port
   or interface with legacy C code.

    D

   D is a general purpose systems and applications programming language. It
   is a higher level language than C++, but retains the ability to write high
   performance code and interface directly with the operating system APIs and
   with hardware. D is well suited to writing medium to large scale million
   line programs with teams of developers. It is easy to learn, provides many
   capabilities to aid the programmer, and is well suited to aggressive
   compiler optimization technology. D is not a scripting language, nor an
   interpreted language. It doesn't come with a VM, a religion, or an
   overriding philosophy. It's a practical language for practical programmers
   who need to get the job done quickly, reliably, and leave behind
   maintainable, easy to understand code. D is the culmination of decades of
   experience implementing compilers for many diverse languages, and
   attempting to construct large projects using those languages. It draws
   inspiration from those other languages (most especially C++) and tempers
   it with experience and real world practicality.

   Dylan is an advanced, object-oriented, dynamic language which supports
   rapid program development. When needed, programs can be optimized for more
   efficient execution by supplying more type information to the compiler.
   Nearly all entities in Dylan (including functions, classes, and basic data
   types such as integers) are first class objects. Additionally, Dylan
   supports multiple inheritance, polymorphism, multiple dispatch, keyword
   arguments, object introspection, macros, and many other advanced
   features... --Peter Hinely.

    E

   E is a secure distributed Java-based pure-object platform and p2p
   scripting language. It has two parts: ELib and the E Language. Elib
   provides the stuff that goes on between objects. As a pure-Java library,
   ELib provides for inter-process capability-secure distributed programming.
   Its cryptographic capability protocol enables mutually suspicious Java
   processes to cooperate safely, and its event-loop concurrency and promise
   pipelining enable high performance deadlock free distributed pure-object
   computing. The E Language can be used to express what happens within an
   object. It provides a convenient and familiar notation for the ELib
   computational model, so you can program in one model rather than two.
   Under the covers, this notation expands into Kernel-E, a minimalist
   lambda-language much like Scheme or Smalltalk. Objects written in the E
   language are only able to interact with other objects according to ELib's
   semantics, enabling object granularity intra-process security, including
   the ability to safely run untrusted mobile code (such as caplets).

   a C like syntax. Its main characteristics are: open source, interpreted,
   has portable bytecode compilation, dynamic typing, automatic real very
   fast garbage collection, object oriented with meta-programming support (a
   la Smalltalk), functional programming support (Scheme-like closures with
   lexical scoping, and eval-like functionality), hierarchical namespaces, a
   rich set of useful built-in types (dynamic arrays, dictionaries, symbols,
   ...), extensible with C (you can add functions, types, classes, methods,
   packages, ...), embeddable in C. elastiC has been strongly influenced by
   C, Smalltalk, Scheme and Python and tries to merge the best
   characteristics of all these languages, while still coherently maintaining

    Felix

   Felix is an advanced Algol like procedural programming language with a
   strong functional subsystem. It features ML style static typing, first
   class functions, pattern matching, garbage collection, polymorphism, and
   has built in support for high performance microthreading, regular
   expressions and context free parsing. The system provides a scripting
   harness so the language can be used like other scripting languages such as
   Python and Perl, but underneath it generates native code to obtain high
   performance. A key feature of the system is that it uses the C/C++ object
   model, and provides an advanced binding sublanguage to support integration
   with C/C++ at both the source and object levels, both for embedding C/C++
   data types and functions into Felix, and for embedding Felix into existing
   C++ architectures. The Felix compiler is written in Objective Caml, and
   generates ISO C++ which should compile on any platform.

    Joy

   Joy is a purely functional programming language. Whereas all other
   functional programming languages are based on the application of functions
   to arguments, Joy is based on the composition of functions. All such
   functions take a stack as an argument and produce a stack as a value.
   Consequently much of Joy looks like ordinary postfix notation. However, in
   Joy a function can consume any number of parameters from the stack and
   leave any number of results on the stack. The concatenation of appropriate
   programs denotes the composition of the functions which the programs
   denote.

    Q

   Q is a functional programming language based on term rewriting. Thus, a Q
   program or âscriptâ is simply a collection of equations which are used to
   evaluate expressions in a symbolic fashion. The equations establish
   algebraic identities and are interpreted as rewriting rules in order to
   reduce expressions to ânormal formsâ.

    R

   R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. It
   is a GNU project similar to the S language and environment which was
   developed at Bell Laboratories (formerly AT&T, now Lucent Technologies) by
   John Chambers and colleagues. R can be considered as a different
   implementation of S. There are some important differences, but much code
   written for S runs unaltered under R. R provides a wide variety of
   statistical (linear and nonlinear modelling, classical statistical tests,
   time-series analysis, classification, clustering, ...) and graphical
   techniques, and is highly extensible. The S language is often the vehicle
   of choice for research in statistical methodology, and R provides an Open
   Source route to participation in that activity.

    SmartEiffel (The GNU Eiffel Compiler)

   SmartEiffel claims to be âthe fastest and the slimmest multi-platform
   Eiffel compiler on Earthâ. Eiffel is an object-oriented programming
   language which emphasizes the production of robust software. Its syntax is
   keyword-oriented in the ALGOL and Pascal tradition. Eiffel is strongly
   statically typed, with automatic memory management (typically implemented
   by garbage collection). Distinguishing characteristics of Eiffel include
   Design by contract (DbC), liberal use of inheritance including multiple
   inheritance, a type system handling both value and reference semantics,
   and generic classes. Eiffel has a unified type systemâall types in Eiffel
   are classes, so it is possible to create subclasses of the basic classes
   such as INTEGER. Eiffel has operator overloading, including the ability to
   define new operators, but does not have method overloading.

    Yorick

   Yorick is an interpreted programming language, designed for postprocessing
   or steering large scientific simulation codes. Smaller scientific
   simulations or calculations, such as the flow past an airfoil or the
   motion of a drumhead, can be written as standalone yorick programs. The
   language features a compact syntax for many common array operations, so it
   processes large arrays of numbers very efficiently. Unlike most
   interpreters, which are several hundred times slower than compiled code
   for number crunching, Yorick can approach to within a factor of four or
   five of compiled speed for many common tasks. Superficially, Yorick code
   resembles C code, but Yorick variables are never explicitly declared and
   have a dynamic scoping similar to many Lisp dialects. The âunofficialâ

  Programming Libraries and Bindings

    Byte Code Engineering Library (BCEL)

   BECL is intended to give users a convenient possibility to analyze,
   create, and manipulate (binary) Java class files (those ending with
   .class). Classes are represented by objects which contain all the symbolic
   information of the given class: methods, fields and byte code
   instructions, in particular. Such objects can be read from an existing
   file, be transformed by a program (e.g., a class loader at run-time) and
   dumped to a file again. An even more interesting application is the
   creation of classes from scratch at run-time. The Byte Code Engineering
   Library may be also useful if you want to learn about the Java Virtual
   Machine (JVM) and the format of Java .class files. BCEL is already being
   used successfully in several projects such as compilers, optimizers,
   obfuscators, code generators and analysis tools.

Java-12.0.2

  About Java

   Java is different from most of the packages in LFS and BLFS. It is a
   programming language that works with files of byte codes to obtain
   instructions and executes then in a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). An
   introductory java program looks like:

 public class HelloWorld
 {
     public static void main(String[] args)
     {
         System.out.println("Hello, World");
     }
 }

   This program is saved as HelloWorld.java. The file name, HelloWorld, must
   match the class name. It is then converted into byte code with javac
   HelloWorld.java. The output file is HelloWorld.class. The program is
   executed with java HelloWorld. This creates a JVM and runs the code. The
   'class' extension must not be specified.

   Several class files can be combined into one file with the jar command.
   This is similar to the standard tar command. For instance, the command jar
   cf myjar.jar *.class will combine all class files in a directory into one
   jar file. These act as library files.

   The JVM can search for and use classes in jar files automatically. It uses
   the CLASSPATH environment variable to search for jar files. This is a
   standard list of colon-separated directory names similar to the PATH
   environment variable.

  Binary JDK Information

   Creating a JVM from source requires a set of circular dependencies. The
   first thing that's needed is a set of programs called a Java Development
   Kit (JDK). This set of programs includes java, javac, jar, and several
   others. It also includes several base jar files.

   To start, we set up a binary installation of the JDK created by the BLFS
   editors. It is installed in the /opt directory to allow for multiple
   installations, including a source based version.

   This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS-9.0
   platform.

 mv -v * /opt/OpenJDK-12.0.2+10-bin         &&
 chown -R root:root /opt/OpenJDK-12.0.2+10-bin

   The binary version is now installed. You may create a symlink to that
   version by issuing, as the root user:

 ln -sfn OpenJDK-12.0.2+10-bin /opt/jdk

   You may now proceed to Configuring the JAVA environment, where the
   instructions assume that the above link exists.

OpenJDK-12.0.2

  Introduction to OpenJDK

   OpenJDK is an open-source implementation of Oracle's Java Standard Edition
   platform. OpenJDK is useful for developing Java programs, and provides a
   complete runtime environment to run Java programs.

   This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS-9.0
   platform.

   OpenJDK is GPL'd code, with a special exception made for non-free projects
   to use these classes in their proprietary products. In similar fashion to
   the LGPL, which allows non-free programs to link to libraries provided by
   free software, the GNU General Public License, version 2, with the
   Classpath Exception allows third party programs to use classes provided by
   free software without the requirement that the third party software also
   be free. As with the LGPL, any modifications made to the free software
   portions of a third party application, must also be made freely available.

  Note

   The OpenJDK source includes a very thorough, open source test suite using
   the JTreg test harness. The testing instructions below allow to test the
   just built JDK for reasonable compatibility with the proprietary Oracle
   JDK. However, in order for an independent implementation to claim
   compatibility, it must pass a proprietary JCK/TCK test suite. No claims of
   compatibility, even partial compatibility, may be made without passing an
   approved test suite.

   Oracle does provide free community access, on a case by case basis, to a
   closed toolkit to ensure 100% compatibility with its proprietary JDK.
   Neither the binary version provided on the Java-12.0.2 page nor the JVM
   built with the instructions below have been tested against the TCK. Any
   version that is built using the instructions given, cannot claim to be
   compatible with the proprietary JDK, without the user applying for, and
   completing the compatibility tests themselves.

   With that in mind, the binaries produced using this build method are
   regularly tested against the TCK by the members listed on the site above.
   In addition to the community license above, an educational, non-commercial
   license for the TCK can be obtained from here.

   twm-1.0.10 (for the tests), and pandoc

   User Notes: http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/openjdk

  Installation of OpenJDK

   If you have downloaded the optional test harness, unpack it now:

 tar -xf ../jtreg-4.2-b13-517.tar.gz

  Note

   Before proceeding, you should ensure that your environment PATH variable
   contains the location of the Java compiler used for bootstrapping OpenJDK.
   This is the only requirement for the environment. Modern Java
   installations do not need JAVA_HOME and CLASSPATH is not used here.
   Furthermore, OpenJDK developers recommend to unset JAVA_HOME.

   The build system does not support the -j switch in MAKEFLAGS. See the
   command explanation for --with-jobs= and --with-test-jobs= for more
   information on customizing parallelization.

   Configure and build the package with the following commands
   (--with-milestone value can be modified to fit user preferences):

 unset JAVA_HOME                             &&
 bash configure --enable-unlimited-crypto    \
                --disable-warnings-as-errors \
                --with-stdc++lib=dynamic     \
                --with-giflib=system         \
                --with-jtreg=$PWD/jtreg      \
                --with-lcms=system           \
                --with-libjpeg=system        \
                --with-libpng=system         \
                --with-zlib=system           \
                --with-version-build="10"    \
                --with-version-pre=""        \
                --with-version-opt=""        \
                --with-cacerts-file=/etc/pki/tls/java/cacerts &&
 make images

   To test the results, you will need to execute the jtreg program. You can
   set the number of concurrent tests by adding the -conc:<X> value in the
   below command (tests will run sequentially otherwise):

 export JT_JAVA=$(echo $PWD/build/*/jdk) &&
 jtreg/bin/jtreg -jdk:$JT_JAVA -automatic -ignore:quiet -v1 \
     test/jdk:tier1 test/langtools:tier1 &&
 unset JT_JAVA

   For more control over the test suite, review the documentation available
   in jtreg/doc/jtreg/usage.txt. To review the results, see the files
   JTreport/test_{jdk,langtools}/text/stats.txt and
   JTreport/test_{jdk,langtools}/text/summary.txt. You should expect to see
   around 40 failures and a couple of errors.

   Install the package with the following commands as the root user:

 install -vdm755 /opt/jdk-12.0.2+10             &&
 cp -Rv build/*/images/jdk/* /opt/jdk-12.0.2+10 &&
 chown -R root:root /opt/jdk-12.0.2+10          &&
 for s in 16 24 32 48; do
   install -vDm644 src/java.desktop/unix/classes/sun/awt/X11/java-icon${s}.png \
                   /usr/share/icons/hicolor/${s}x${s}/apps/java.png
 done

  Note

   If you only wish to install the Java Runtime Environment, you can
   substitute build/*/images/jre in the above cp command.

   There are now two OpenJDK SDKs installed in /opt. You should decide on
   which one you would like to use as the default. Normally, you would opt
   for the just installed OpenJDK. If so, do the following as the root user:

 ln -v -nsf jdk-12.0.2+10 /opt/jdk

   If desired, you may create .desktop files to add entries in the menu for
   java, policytool, and jconsole. The needed icons have already been
   installed. As the root user:

 mkdir -pv /usr/share/applications &&

 cat > /usr/share/applications/openjdk-java.desktop << "EOF" &&
 [Desktop Entry]
 Name=OpenJDK Java 12.0.2 Runtime

  Command Explanations

   bash configure...: the top level configure is a wrapper around the
   autotools one. It is not executable and must be run through bash.

   --enable-unlimited-crypto: Because of limitations on the usage of
   cryptography in some countries, there is the possibility to limit the size
   of encryption keys and the use of some algorithms in a policy file. This
   switch allows to ship a policy file with no restriction. It is the
   responsibility of the user to ensure proper adherence to the law.

   --disable-warnings-as-errors: This switch disables use of -Werror in the
   build.

   --with-stdc++lib=dynamic: This switch forces the build system to link to
   libstdc++.so (dynamic) instead of libstdc++.a (static).

   --with-jobs=<X>: The -j passed to make does not work with make as invoked
   here. By default, the build system will use the number of CPUs - 1.

   --with-jtreg=$PWD/jtreg: This switch tells configure where to find jtreg.
   Omit if you have not downloaded the optional test suite.

   --with-{giflib,lcms,libjpeg,libpng,zlib}=system: These switches force the
   build system to use the system libraries instead of the bundled versions.

   --with-version-build: Currently, the build system does not include the
   build number in the version string. It has to be specified here.

   --with-version-pre: This switch allows you to prefix the version string
   with a custom string.

   --with-version-opt: This switch allows you to add an optional build
   description to the version string.

   --with-cacerts-file=/etc/pki/tls/java/cacerts: Specifies where to find a
   cacerts file, /etc/pki/tls/java/ on a BLFS system. Otherwise, an empty one
   is created. You can use the /usr/sbin/make-ca --force command to generate
   it, once you have installed the Java binaries.

   --with-boot-jdk: This switch provides the location of the temporary JDK.
   It is normally not needed if java is found in the PATH.

   find ... -iname '*.diz' -delete: This command removes redundant files.

  Configuring OpenJDK

    Configuration Information

   Normally, the JAVA environment has been configured after installing the
   binary version, and can be used with the just built package as well.
   Review Configuring the JAVA environment in case you want to modify
   something.

   To test if the man pages are correctly installed, issue source
   /etc/profile and man java to display the respective man page.

    Settting up the JRE Certificate Authority Certificates (cacerts) file

   If you have run the instructions on the make-ca-1.4 page, you only need to
   create a symlink in the default location for the cacerts file. As user
   root:

 ln -sfv /etc/pki/tls/java/cacerts /opt/jdk/lib/security/cacerts

   To check the installation, issue:

 cd /opt/jdk
 bin/keytool -list -cacerts

   At the prompt Enter keystore password:, enter changeit (the default) or
   just press the âEnterâ key. If the cacerts file was installed correctly,
   you will see a list of the certificates with related information for each
   one. If not, you need to reinstall them.

Configuring the JAVA environment

  Setting up the environment

   After the package installation is complete, the next step is to make sure
   that the system can properly find the files. If you set up your login
   scripts as recommended in The Bash Shell Startup Files, update the
   environment by creating the openjdk.sh script, as the root user:

 cat > /etc/profile.d/openjdk.sh << "EOF"
 # Begin /etc/profile.d/openjdk.sh

 # Set JAVA_HOME directory
 JAVA_HOME=/opt/jdk

 # Adjust PATH
 pathappend $JAVA_HOME/bin

 # Add to MANPATH
 pathappend $JAVA_HOME/man MANPATH

 # Auto Java CLASSPATH: Copy jar files to, or create symlinks in, the
 # /usr/share/java directory. Note that having gcj jars with OpenJDK 8
 # may lead to errors.

 AUTO_CLASSPATH_DIR=/usr/share/java

 pathprepend . CLASSPATH

 for dir in `find ${AUTO_CLASSPATH_DIR} -type d 2>/dev/null`; do
     pathappend $dir CLASSPATH
 done

 for jar in `find ${AUTO_CLASSPATH_DIR} -name "*.jar" 2>/dev/null`; do
     pathappend $jar CLASSPATH
 done

 export JAVA_HOME
 unset AUTO_CLASSPATH_DIR dir jar

 # End /etc/profile.d/openjdk.sh
 EOF

   If Sudo-1.8.27 is installed, the super user should have access to the
   above variables. Execute the following commands as the root user:

 cat > /etc/sudoers.d/java << "EOF"
 Defaults env_keep += JAVA_HOME
 Defaults env_keep += CLASSPATH
 EOF

   For allowing mandb to include the OpenJDK man pages in its database,
   issue, as the root user:

 cat >> /etc/man_db.conf << "EOF" &&
 # Begin Java addition
 MANDATORY_MANPATH     /opt/jdk/man
 MANPATH_MAP           /opt/jdk/bin     /opt/jdk/man
 MANDB_MAP             /opt/jdk/man     /var/cache/man/jdk
 # End Java addition
 EOF

 mkdir -p /var/cache/man &&
 mandb -c /opt/jdk/man

  Setting up the Certificate Authority Certificates for Java

   OpenJDK uses its own format for the CA certificates. The Java security
   modules use $JAVA_HOME/lib/security/cacerts by default. In order to keep
   all the certificates in one place, we use /etc/ssl/java/cacerts. The
   instructions on the make-ca-1.4 page previously created the file located
   in /etc/ssl/java. Setup a symlink in the default location as the root
   user:

 ln -sfv /etc/pki/tls/java/cacerts /opt/jdk/lib/security/cacerts

   Use the following command to check if the cacerts file has been
   successfully installed:

 /opt/jdk/bin/keytool -list -cacerts

   At the prompt Enter keystore password:, enter changeit (the default) or
   just press the âEnterâ key. If the cacerts file was installed correctly,
   you will see a list of the certificates with related information for each
   one. If not, you need to reinstall them.

   If you later install a new JVM, you just have to create the symlink in the
   default location to be able to use the cacerts.

apache-ant-1.10.6

  Introduction to Apache Ant

   The Apache Ant package is a Java-based build tool. In theory, it is like
   the make command, but without make's wrinkles. Ant is different. Instead
   of a model that is extended with shell-based commands, Ant is extended
   using Java classes. Instead of writing shell commands, the configuration
   files are XML-based, calling out a target tree that executes various
   tasks. Each task is run by an object that implements a particular task
   interface.

   This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS-9.0
   platform.

    Apache Ant Dependencies

      Required

   A JDK (Java Binary or OpenJDK-12.0.2) and GLib-2.60.6

   User Notes: http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/apache-ant

  Installation of Apache Ant

   First fix an incompatibility issue between the documentation standard used
   in the build tree, and the one expected by OpenJDK-12.0.2:

 sed -i 's/--add-modules java.activation/-html4/' build.xml

   Build a limited bootstrap version of Apache Ant using the following
   command:

 ./bootstrap.sh

   Download the runtime dependencies using the fetch.xml ant build script:

 bootstrap/bin/ant -f fetch.xml -Ddest=optional

   Build Apache Ant by running the following command:

 ./build.sh -Ddist.dir=$PWD/ant-1.10.6 dist

   Install, as the root user:

 cp -rv ant-1.10.6 /opt/            &&
 chown -R root:root /opt/ant-1.10.6 &&
 ln -sfv ant-1.10.6 /opt/ant

  Command Explanations

   bootstrap/bin/ant -f fetch.xml -Ddest=optional: Downloads the missing
   dependencies to user's home directory, and copy them into the source tree
   (in the lib/optional directory, where ant picks them up at build time).

   ./build.sh -Ddist.dir=$PWD/ant-1.10.6 dist: This command builds, tests,
   then installs the package into a temporary directory.

  Configuring Apache Ant

    Config Files

   /etc/ant/ant.conf, ~/.ant/ant.conf, and ~/.antrc

    Configuration Information

   Some packages will require ant to be in the search path and the ANT_HOME
   environment variable defined. Satisfy these requirements by issuing, as
   the root user:

 cat > /etc/profile.d/ant.sh << EOF
 # Begin /etc/profile.d/ant.sh

 pathappend /opt/ant/bin
 export ANT_HOME=/opt/ant

 # End /etc/profile.d/ant.sh
 EOF

   The above instrutions assume you have configured your system as described
   in The Bash Shell Startup Files.

  Contents

   Installed Programs: ant, antRun, antRun.pl, complete-ant-cmd.pl,
   runant.pl, and runant.py
   Installed Libraries: Numerous ant*.jar and dependant libraries in
   $ANT_HOME/lib
   Installed Directories: /opt/ant-1.10.6

    Short Descriptions

   ant                 is a Java based build tool used by many packages       
                       instead of the conventional make program.              
   antRun              is a support script used to start ant build scripts in 
                       a given directory.                                     
   antRun.pl           is a Perl script that provides similar functionality   
                       offered by the antRun script.                          
   complete-ant-cmd.pl is a Perl script that allows Bash to complete an ant   
                       command-line.                                          
   runant.pl           is a Perl wrapper script used to invoke ant.           
   runant.py           is a Python wrapper script used to invoke ant.         
   ant*.jar            files are the Apache Ant Java class libraries.

                              Part IV. Networking

Chapter 14. Connecting to a Network

   The LFS book covers setting up networking by connecting to a LAN with a
   static IP address. There are other methods used to obtain an IP address
   and connect to a LAN and other networks (such as the Internet). The most
   popular methods (DHCP and PPP) are covered in this chapter.

   DHCP stands for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol. It is a protocol used
   by many sites to automatically provide information such as IP addresses,
   subnet masks and routing information to computers. If your network uses
   DHCP, you will need a DHCP client in order to connect to it.

   PPP stands for Point-to-Point Protocol. It is a data link protocol
   commonly used for establishing authenticated IP connections over a phone
   line with a modem, or over radio waves with a cellular phone. There is
   also a variant (PPPoE) that works over Ethernet and is used by cable
   providers to authenticate the Internet connections.

dhcpcd-8.0.3

  Introduction to dhcpcd

   dhcpcd is an implementation of the DHCP client specified in RFC2131. A
   DHCP client is useful for connecting your computer to a network which uses
   DHCP to assign network addresses. dhcpcd strives to be a fully featured,
   yet very lightweight DHCP client.

   This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS-9.0
   platform.

   User Notes: http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/dhcpcd

  Installation of dhcpcd

   Install dhcpcd by running the following commands:

 ./configure --libexecdir=/lib/dhcpcd \
             --dbdir=/var/lib/dhcpcd  &&
 make

   To test the results, issue: make test.

   Now, as the root user:

 make install

  Command Explanations

   --libexecdir=/lib/dhcpcd: The default /libexec is not FHS-compliant. Since
   this directory may need to be available early in the boot, /usr/libexec
   cannot be used either.

   --dbdir=/var/lib/dhcpcd: The default /var/db is not FHS-compliant

   --with-hook=...: You can optionally install more hooks, for example to
   install some configuration files such as ntp.conf. The set of hooks is in
   the dhcpcd-hooks directory in the build tree.

  Configuring dhcpcd

    Config Files

   /etc/dhcpcd.conf

    General Configuration Information

   To configure dhcpcd, you need to first install the network service script,
   /lib/services/dhcpcd included in the blfs-bootscripts-20190609 package (as
   user root):

 make install-service-dhcpcd

   Whenever dhcpcd configures or shuts down a network interface, it executes
   hook scripts. For more details about those scripts, see the
   dhcpcd-run-hooks and dhcpcd man pages.

   Finally, as the root user create the /etc/sysconfig/ifconfig.eth0
   configuration file using the following commands. Adjust appropriately for
   additional interfaces:

 cat > /etc/sysconfig/ifconfig.eth0 << "EOF"
 ONBOOT="yes"
 IFACE="eth0"
 SERVICE="dhcpcd"
 DHCP_START="-b -q <insert appropriate start options here>"
 DHCP_STOP="-k <insert additional stop options here>"
 EOF

   For more information on the appropriate DHCP_START and DHCP_STOP values,
   examine the man page for dhcpcd.

  Note

   The default behavior of dhcpcd sets the hostname and mtu settings. It also
   overwrites /etc/resolv.conf and /etc/ntp.conf. These modifications to
   system files and settings on system configuration files are done by hooks
   which are stored in /lib/dhcpcd/dhcpcd-hooks. Setup dhcpcd by removing or
   adding hooks from/to that directory. The execution of hooks can be
   disabled by using the --nohook (-C) command line option or by the nohook
   option in the /etc/dhcpcd.conf file.

   Review the dhcpcd man page for switches to add to the DHCP_START value.

    Configuration Information: fixed ip

   Although not usual, it is possible that you need to configure dhcpcd to
   use a fixed ip. Here, we give an example. As the root user create the
   /etc/sysconfig/ifconfig.eth0 configuration file using the following
   commands. Adjust appropriately for additional interfaces and for the
   actual ip and router you need:

 cat > /etc/sysconfig/ifconfig.eth0 << "EOF"
 ONBOOT="yes"
 IFACE="eth0"
 SERVICE="dhcpcd"
 DHCP_START="-b -q -S ip_address=192.168.0.10/24 -S routers=192.168.0.1"
 DHCP_STOP="-k"
 EOF

   You can either use DNS servers in /etc/resolv.conf from another system,
   your preferred servers, or just the example /etc/resolv.conf.head file
   below as is:

 cat > /etc/resolv.conf.head << "EOF"
 # OpenDNS servers
 nameserver 208.67.222.222
 nameserver 208.67.220.220
 EOF

  Contents

   Installed Program: dhcpcd
   Installed Library: /lib/dhcpcd/dev/udev.so
   Installed Directory: /{,var/}lib/dhcpcd and /usr/share/dhcpcd

    Short Descriptions

   dhcpcd  is an implementation of the DHCP client specified in RFC2131.      
   udev.so adds udev support for interface arrival and departure; this is     
           because udev likes to rename the interface, which it can't do if   
           dhcpcd grabs it first.

DHCP-4.4.1

  Introduction to ISC DHCP

   The ISC DHCP package contains both the client and server programs for
   DHCP. dhclient (the client) is used for connecting to a network which uses
   DHCP to assign network addresses. dhcpd (the server) is used for assigning
   network addresses on private networks.

   This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS-9.0
   platform.

  Kernel Configuration

   You must have Packet Socket support. IPv6 support is optional.

 [*] Networking support --->        [CONFIG_NET]
       Networking options --->
         <*> Packet socket          [CONFIG_PACKET]
         <*> The IPv6 Protocol ---> [CONFIG_IPV6]

  Installation of ISC DHCP

  Note

   This package does not support parallel build.

  Note

   Be careful with the instructions below. The single and double quotes are
   important because the defined variables are used verbatim in the code.

   Install ISC DHCP by running the following commands:

 ( export CFLAGS="$CFLAGS -Wall -fno-strict-aliasing                 \
         -D_PATH_DHCLIENT_SCRIPT='\"/sbin/dhclient-script\"'         \
         -D_PATH_DHCPD_CONF='\"/etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf\"'               \
         -D_PATH_DHCLIENT_CONF='\"/etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf\"'"        &&

 ./configure --prefix=/usr                                           \
             --sysconfdir=/etc/dhcp                                  \
             --localstatedir=/var                                    \
             --with-srv-lease-file=/var/lib/dhcpd/dhcpd.leases       \
             --with-srv6-lease-file=/var/lib/dhcpd/dhcpd6.leases     \
             --with-cli-lease-file=/var/lib/dhclient/dhclient.leases \
             --with-cli6-lease-file=/var/lib/dhclient/dhclient6.leases
 ) &&
 make -j1

   This package does not come with a test suite.

   If you only want to install the ISC DHCP client, issue the following
   commands as the root user:

 make -C client install         &&
 mv -v /usr/sbin/dhclient /sbin &&
 install -v -m755 client/scripts/linux /sbin/dhclient-script

   Skip to the section called âClient Configurationâ in order to configure
   the client

   If you only want to install the ISC DHCP server, issue the following
   command as the root user:

 make -C server install

   Skip to the section called âServer Configurationâ in order to configure
   the server.

   Alternatively, you can install whole package which includes the client,
   server, relay, static libraries and development headers by running the
   following commands as the root user:

 make install                   &&
 mv -v /usr/sbin/dhclient /sbin &&
 install -v -m755 client/scripts/linux /sbin/dhclient-script

  Configuring ISC DHCP

    Config Files

   /etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf and /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf

    Client Configuration

   Create a basic /etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf by running the following command as
   the root user:

 install -vdm755 /etc/dhcp &&
 cat > /etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf << "EOF"
 # Begin /etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf
 #
 # Basic dhclient.conf(5)

 #prepend domain-name-servers 127.0.0.1;
 request subnet-mask, broadcast-address, time-offset, routers,
         domain-name, domain-name-servers, domain-search, host-name,
         netbios-name-servers, netbios-scope, interface-mtu,
         ntp-servers;
 require subnet-mask, domain-name-servers;
 #timeout 60;
 #retry 60;
 #reboot 10;
 #select-timeout 5;
 #initial-interval 2;

 # End /etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf
 EOF

   See man 5 dhclient.conf for additional options.

   Now create the /var/lib/dhclient directory which will contain DHCP Client
   leases by running the following command as the root user:

 install -v -dm 755 /var/lib/dhclient

   At this point you can test if dhclient is behaving as expected by running
   the following command as the root user:

 dhclient <eth0>

   Replace <eth0> with your desired interface. If you want more verbose
   output, add the -v parameter to the command above.

   If you want to configure network interfaces at boot using dhclient, you
   need to install the /lib/services/dhclient script included in
   blfs-bootscripts-20190609 package:

 make install-service-dhclient

   Next, create the /etc/sysconfig/ifconfig.eth0 configuration file with the
   following commands as the root user:

 cat > /etc/sysconfig/ifconfig.eth0 << "EOF"
 ONBOOT="yes"
 IFACE="eth0"
 SERVICE="dhclient"
 DHCP_START=""
 DHCP_STOP=""

 # Set PRINTIP="yes" to have the script print
 # the DHCP assigned IP address
 PRINTIP="no"

 # Set PRINTALL="yes" to print the DHCP assigned values for
 # IP, SM, DG, and 1st NS. This requires PRINTIP="yes".
 PRINTALL="no"
 EOF

   Adjust the file to suit your needs.

   For more information on the appropriate DHCP_START and DHCP_STOP values
   see man 8 dhclient.

    Server Configuration

   Note that you only need the DHCP server if you want to issue LAN addresses
   over your network. The DHCP client doesn't need the server in order to
   function properly.

   Start with creating /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf by running the following command
   as the root user:

 cat > /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf << "EOF"
 # Begin /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf
 #
 # Example dhcpd.conf(5)

 # Use this to enable / disable dynamic dns updates globally.
 ddns-update-style none;

 # option definitions common to all supported networks...
 option domain-name "example.org";
 option domain-name-servers ns1.example.org, ns2.example.org;

 default-lease-time 600;
 max-lease-time 7200;

 # This is a very basic subnet declaration.
 subnet 10.254.239.0 netmask 255.255.255.224 {
   range 10.254.239.10 10.254.239.20;
   option routers rtr-239-0-1.example.org, rtr-239-0-2.example.org;
 }

 # End /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf
 EOF

   Adjust the file to suit your needs. See man 5 dhcpd.conf for additional
   options.

   Now create the /var/lib/dhcpd directory which will contain DHCP Server
   leases by running the following command as the root user:

 install -v -dm 755 /var/lib/dhcpd

   If you want to start the DHCP Server at boot, install the
   /etc/rc.d/init.d/dhcpd inti script included in the
   blfs-bootscripts-20190609 package:

 make install-dhcpd

   You will need to edit the /etc/sysconfig/dhcpd in order to set the
   interface on which dhcpd will serve the DHCP requests.

  Contents

   Installed Programs: dhclient, dhclient-script, dhcpd, dhcrelay and omshell
   Installed Libraries: libdhcpctl.a and libomapi.a

    Short Descriptions

   dhclient        is the implementation of the DHCP client.                  
   dhclient-script is used by dhclient to (re)configure interfaces. It can    
                   make extra changes by invoking custom                      
                   dhclient-{entry,exit}-hooks.                               
   dhcpd           implements Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) and  
                   Internet Bootstrap Protocol (BOOTP) requests for network   
                   addresses.                                                 
   dhcrelay        provides a means to accept DHCP and BOOTP requests on a    
                   subnet without a DHCP server and relay them to a DHCP      
                   server on another subnet.                                  
   omshell         provides an interactive way to connect to, query and       
                   possibly change the ISC DHCP Server's state via OMAPI, the 
                   Object Management API.

  Kernel Configuration

   Enable the following options in the kernel configuration and recompile the
   kernel if necessary:

 [*] Networking support --->            [CONFIG_NET]
       Networking options --->
         <*/M> 802.1d Ethernet Bridging [CONFIG_BRIDGE]

  Installation of bridge-utils

   Install bridge-utils by running the following commands:

 autoconf                  &&
 ./configure --prefix=/usr &&
 make

   Testing the results requires running the six shell scripts in the tools/
   directory. Two of the tests require two ethernet ports. Some tests will
   not preserve the current network configuration. See tests/README for
   details.

   Now, as the root user:

 make install

  Configuring bridge-utils

    Configuration Information

   To automate bridge creation and configuration, install the
   /lib/services/etc/bridge service script included in the
   blfs-bootscripts-20190609 package.

 make install-service-bridge

  Note

   The bridge script depends on the commands /sbin/ifup and /sbin/ifdown and
   the service script ipv4-static from the LFS bootscripts dated January 27,
   2012 or later.

   The following configuration file will create a bridge device at boot time
   and attach the eth0 device to it. If more than one device is desired, use
   a space separated list of INTERFACE_COMPONENTS. This configuration is
   useful when planning to run a virtual machine such as kvm/qemu.

   Other SERVICE combinations are possible, for example, SERVICES="bridge
   dhcp". In that case, the address parameters are not needed, but do not
   interfere if present. The bridge service may also be used alone, but will
   require additional subsequent configuration.

  Caution

   Do not run a parallel configuration for a device in the
   INTERFACE_COMPONENTS list. For instance, in the example below, do not
   configure /etc/sysconfig/ifconfig.eth0 to run at boot time. The command
   ifdown br0 followed by command ifup eth0 will work, but don't try to have
   both up at the same time.

 cat > /etc/sysconfig/ifconfig.br0 << "EOF"
 ONBOOT=yes
 IFACE=br0
 VIRTINT=yes
 SERVICE="bridge ipv4-static"  # Space separated

    Short Descriptions

   cifs.idmap  is a userspace helper program for the linux CIFS client        
               filesystem. There are a number of activities that the kernel   
               cannot easily do itself. This program is a callout program     
               that does these things for the kernel and then returns the     
               result. It is not intended to be run from the command-line.    
   cifs.upcall is a userspace helper program for the linux CIFS client        
               filesystem. It is intended to be run when the kernel calls     
               request-key for a particular key type. It is not intended to   
               be run from the command-line.                                  
   cifscreds   is a tool for managing credentials (username and password) for 
               the purpose of establishing sessions in multiuser mounts.      
   getcifsacl  is a userspace helper to display an ACL in a security          
               descriptor for Common Internet File System (CIFS).             
   mount.cifs  mounts a Linux CIFS filesystem. It is usually invoked          
               indirectly by the mount(8) command when using the "-t cifs"    
               option.                                                        
   setcifsacl  is intended to alter an ACL of a security descriptor for a     
               file system object.                                            
   smbinfo     displays SMB-specific file information, such as security

  Kernel Configuration

   To use Wireless Tools, the kernel must have the appropriate drivers and
   other support available. The appropriate bus must also be available. For
   oldere laptops, the PCMCIA bus (CONFIG_PCCARD) needs to be built. In some
   cases, this bus support will also need to be built for embedded iw cards.
   The appropriate bridge support also needs to be built. For many modern
   laptops, the CardBus host bridge (CONFIG_YENTA) will be needed.

   In addition to the bus, the actual driver for the specific wireless card
   must also be available. There are many wireless cards and they don't all
   work with Linux. The first place to look for card support is the kernel.
   The drivers are located in Device Drivers â Network Device Support â
   Wireless LAN (non-hamradio). There are also external drivers available for
   some very common cards. For more information, look at the user notes.

   After the correct drivers are loaded, the interface will appear in
   /proc/net/wireless.

  Installation of iw

   To install iw, use the following commands:

 sed -i "/INSTALL.*gz/s/.gz//" Makefile &&
 make

   This package does not come with a test suite.

   Now, as the root user:

 make SBINDIR=/sbin install

NcFTP-3.2.6

  Introduction to NcFTP

   The NcFTP package contains a powerful and flexible interface to the
   Internet standard File Transfer Protocol. It is intended to replace or
   supplement the stock ftp program.

   This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS-9.0
   platform.

      Optional

   LLVM-8.0.1 (with Clang, used by default if installed)

   User Notes: http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/ncftp

  Installation of NcFTP

   There are two ways to build NcFTP. The first (and optimal) way builds most
   of the functionality as a shared library and then builds and installs the
   program linked against this library. The second method simply links all of
   the functionality into the binary statically. This doesn't make the
   dynamic library available for linking by other applications. You need to
   choose which method best suits you. Note that the second method does not
   create an entirely statically linked binary; only the libncftp parts are
   statically linked in, in this case. Be aware that building and using the
   shared library is covered by the Clarified Artistic License; however,
   developing applications that utilize the shared library is subject to a
   different license.

   To install NcFTP using the first (and optimal) method, run the following
   commands:

 ./configure --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc &&
 make -C libncftp shared &&
 make

   This package does not come with a test suite.

   Now, as the root user:

 make -C libncftp soinstall &&
 make install

   To install NcFTP using the second method (with the libncftp functionality
   linked in statically) run the following commands:

 ./configure --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc &&
 make

   This package does not come with a test suite.

   Now, as the root user:

 make install

  Command Explanations

   make -C ... && make -C ...: These commands make and install the dynamic
   library libncftp which is then used to link against when compiling the
   main program.

  Configuring NcFTP

    Config Files

   /etc/ncftp.* and ~/.ncftp/*; especially /etc/ncftp.prefs_v3 and
   ~/.ncftp/prefs_v3

    Configuration Information

   Most NcFTP configuration is done while in the program, and the
   configuration files are dealt with automatically. One exception to this is
   ~/.ncftp/prefs_v3. There are various options to alter in there, including:

 yes-i-know-about-NcFTPd=yes

   This disables the splash screen advertising the NcFTPd server.

   There are other options in the prefs_v3 file. Most of these are
   self-explanatory. Global defaults can be set in /etc/ncftp.prefs_v3.

Net-tools-CVS_20101030

  Introduction to Net-tools

   The Net-tools package is a collection of programs for controlling the
   network subsystem of the Linux kernel.

   User Notes: http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/net-tools

  Installation of Net-tools

   The instructions below automate the configuration process by piping yes to
   the make config command. If you wish to run the interactive configuration
   process (by changing the instruction to just make config), but you are not
   sure how to answer all the questions, then just accept the defaults. This
   will be just fine in the majority of cases. What you're asked here is a
   bunch of questions about which network protocols you've enabled in your
   kernel. The default answers will enable the tools from this package to
   work with the most common protocols: TCP, PPP, and several others. You
   still need to actually enable these protocols in the kernelâwhat you do
   here is merely tell the package to include support for those protocols in
   its programs, but it's up to the kernel to make the protocols available.

  Note

   This package has several unneeded protocols and hardware device specific
   functions that are obsolete. To only build the minimum needed for your
   system, skip the yes command and answer each question interactively. The
   minimum needed options are 'UNIX protocol family' and 'INET (TCP/IP)
   protocol family'.

   The patch below cleans up the installation so that it does not overwrite
   the ifconfig and hostname programs that were installed in LFS.

   Install Net-tools by running the following commands:

 patch -Np1 -i ../net-tools-CVS_20101030-remove_dups-1.patch &&
 sed -i '/#include <netinet\/ip.h>/d'  iptunnel.c &&

 yes "" | make config &&
 make

   This package does not come with a test suite.

   Now, as the root user:

 make update

  Command Explanations

   sed -i '/#include <netinet\/ip.h>/d' iptunnel.c: This fixes build breakage
   with linux-4.8 headers.

   yes "" | make config: Piping yes to make config skips the interactive
   configuration and accepts the defaults.

  Contents

   Installed Programs: arp, ipmaddr, iptunnel, mii-tool, nameif, netstat,
   plipconfig, rarp, route, and slattach
   Installed Libraries: None
   Installed Directories: None

    Short Descriptions

   arp        is used to manipulate the kernel's ARP cache, usually to add or 
              delete an entry, or to dump the entire cache.                   
   ipmaddr    adds, deletes and shows an interface's multicast addresses.     
   iptunnel   adds, changes, deletes and shows an interface's tunnels.        
   mii-tool   checks or sets the status of a network interface's Media        
              Independent Interface (MII) unit.                               
   nameif     names network interfaces based on MAC addresses.                
   netstat    is used to report network connections, routing tables, and      
              interface statistics.                                           
   plipconfig is used to fine tune the PLIP device parameters, to improve its 
              performance.                                                    
   rarp       is used to manipulate the kernel's RARP table.                  
   route      is used to manipulate the IP routing table.                     
   slattach   attaches a network interface to a serial line. This allows you  
              to use normal terminal lines for point-to-point links to other  
              computers.

NFS-Utils-2.4.1

  Introduction to NFS Utilities

   The NFS Utilities package contains the userspace server and client tools
   necessary to use the kernel's NFS abilities. NFS is a protocol that allows
   sharing file systems over the network.

   This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS-9.0
   platform.

   Kerberos V5-1.17 or libgssapi, and librpcsecgss (for GSS and RPC security
   support) and libcap-2.27 with PAM

      Required (runtime)

   rpcbind-1.2.5

   User Notes: http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/nfs-utils

  Kernel Configuration

   Enable the following options in the kernel configuration (choose client
   and/or server support as appropriate) and recompile the kernel if
   necessary:

 File systems  --->
   [*] Network File Systems  --->         [CONFIG_NETWORK_FILESYSTEMS]
     <*/M> NFS client support             [CONFIG_NFS_FS]
     <*/M> NFS server support             [CONFIG_NFSD]

   Select the appropriate sub-options that appear when the above options are
   selected.

  Note

   In BLFS we assume that nfs v3 will be used. If the server offers nfs v4
   (for linux, CONFIG_NFSD_V4) then auto-negotiation for v3 will fail and you
   will need to add nfsver=3 to the mount options. This also applies if that
   option is enabled in the client's kernel, for example in a distro trying
   to mount from a BLFS v3 server.

   Even if neither end of the connection supports nfs v4, adding nfsver=3 is
   still beneficial because it prevents an error message "NFS: bad mount
   option value specified: minorversion=1" being logged on every mount.

  Installation of NFS Utilities

   Before you compile the program, ensure that the nobody user and nogroup
   group have been created as done in the current LFS book. You can add them
   by running the following commands as the root user:

 groupadd -g 99 nogroup &&
 useradd -c "Unprivileged Nobody" -d /dev/null -g nogroup \
     -s /bin/false -u 99 nobody

  Note

   The classic uid and gid values are 65534 which is also -2 when interpreted
   as a signed 16-bit number. These values impact other files on some
   filesystems that do not have support for sparse files. The nobody and
   nogroup values are relatively arbitrary. The impact on a server is nil if
   the exports file is configured correctly. If it is misconfigured, an ls -l
   or ps listing will show a uid or gid number of 65534 instead of a name.
   The client uses nobody only as the user running rpc.statd.

   Install NFS Utilities by running the following commands:

 ./configure --prefix=/usr          \
             --sysconfdir=/etc      \
             --sbindir=/sbin        \
             --disable-nfsv4        \
             --disable-gss &&
 make

   This package does not come with a working test suite.

   Now, as the root user:

 make install                      &&
 mv -v /sbin/start-statd /usr/sbin &&
 chmod u+w,go+r /sbin/mount.nfs    &&
 chown nobody.nogroup /var/lib/nfs

  Command Explanations

   --disable-nfsv4: This allows the package to be built when libnfsidmap has
   not been installed.

   --disable-gss: Disables support for RPCSEC GSS (RPC Security).

   chown nobody.nogroup /var/lib/nfs: The rpc.statd program uses the
   ownership of this directory to set it's UID and GID. This command sets
   those to unprivileged entries.

  Configuring NFS Utilities

    Server Configuration

   /etc/exports contains the exported directories on NFS servers. Refer to
   the exports.5 manual page for the syntax of this file. Also refer to the
   "NFS HowTo" available at http://nfs.sourceforge.net/nfs-howto/ for
   information on how to configure the servers and clients in a secure
   manner. For example, for sharing the /home directory over the local
   network, the following line may be added:

 cat >> /etc/exports << EOF
 /home 192.168.0.0/24(rw,subtree_check,anonuid=99,anongid=99)
 EOF

  Note

   Be sure to replace the directory, network address. and prefix above to
   match your network. The only space in the line above should be between the
   directory and the network address.

      Boot Script

   Install the /etc/rc.d/init.d/nfs-server init script included in the
   blfs-bootscripts-20190609 package to start the server at boot.

 make install-nfs-server

   Now create the /etc/sysconfig/nfs-server configuration file:

 cat > /etc/sysconfig/nfs-server << "EOF"
 PORT="2049"
 PROCESSES="8"
 KILLDELAY="10"
 EOF

  Note

   The above parameters may be optionally placed in /etc/sysconfig/rc.site.

    Client Configuration

   /etc/fstab contains the directories that are to be mounted on the client.
   Alternately the partitions can be mounted by using the mount command with
   the proper options. To mount the /home and /usr partitions, add the
   following to the /etc/fstab:

 <server-name>:/home  /home nfs   rw,_netdev 0 0
 <server-name>:/usr   /usr  nfs   ro,_netdev 0 0

   The options which can be used are specified in man 5 nfs. If both the
   client and server are running recent versions of linux, most of the
   options will be negotiated (but see the Note above on nfsver=3). You can
   specify either rw or ro, _netdev if the filesystem is to be automatically
   mounted at boot, or noauto (and perhaps user) for other filesystems.

   If the fileserver is not running a recent version of linux, you may need
   to specifiy other options.

   If you are using systemd, you may need to enable autofs v4 in your kernel,
   and add the option comment=systemd.automount. Some machines need this,
   because systemd tries to mount the external fs's before the network is up,
   others do not need it. An alternative is for root to run mount -a.

      Boot Script

  Note

   The following boot script is not required if the nfs-server script is
   installed.

   Install the /etc/rc.d/init.d/nfs-client init script included in the
   blfs-bootscripts-20190609 package to start the client services at boot.

 make install-nfs-client

   To automatically mount nfs filesystems, clients will also need to install
   the netfs bootscript as described in Configuring for Network Filesystems.

Configuring for Network Filesystems

   While LFS is capable of mounting network file systems such as NFS, these
   are not mounted by the mountfs init script. Network file systems must be
   mounted after the networking is activated and unmounted before the network
   goes down. The netfs bootscript was written to handle both boot-time
   mounting of network filesystems, if the entry in /etc/fstab contains the
   _netdev option, and unmounting of all network filesystems before the
   network is brought down.

   As the root user, install the /etc/rc.d/init.d/netfs bootscript included
   with the blfs-bootscripts-20190609 package.

 make install-netfs

ntp-4.2.8p13

  Introduction to ntp

   The ntp package contains a client and server to keep the time synchronized
   between various computers over a network. This package is the official
   reference implementation of the NTP protocol.

   This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS-9.0
   platform.

      Required

   IO-Socket-SSL-2.066

      Optional

   libcap-2.27 with PAM, libevent-2.1.11, libedit, and libopts from AutoGen

   User Notes: http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/ntp

  Installation of ntp

   There should be a dedicated user and group to take control of the ntpd
   daemon after it is started. Issue the following commands as the root user:

 groupadd -g 87 ntp &&
 useradd -c "Network Time Protocol" -d /var/lib/ntp -u 87 \
         -g ntp -s /bin/false ntp

   The update-leap command needs to be fixed in order to run properly:

 sed -e 's/"(\\S+)"/"?([^\\s"]+)"?/' \
     -i scripts/update-leap/update-leap.in

   Install ntp by running the following commands:

 ./configure CFLAGS="-O2 -g -fPIC" \
             --prefix=/usr         \
             --bindir=/usr/sbin    \
             --sysconfdir=/etc     \
             --enable-linuxcaps    \
             --with-lineeditlibs=readline \
             --docdir=/usr/share/doc/ntp-4.2.8p13 &&
 make

   To test the results, issue: make check.

   Now, as the root user:

 make install &&
 install -v -o ntp -g ntp -d /var/lib/ntp

  Command Explanations

   CFLAGS="-O2 -g -fPIC": This environment variable is necessary to generate
   Position Independent Code needed for use in the package libraries.

   --bindir=/usr/sbin: This parameter places the administrative programs in
   /usr/sbin.

   --enable-linuxcaps: ntpd is run as user ntp, so use Linux capabilities for
   non-root clock control.

   --with-lineeditlibs=readline: This switch enables Readline support for
   ntpdc and ntpq programs. If omitted, libedit will be used if installed,
   otherwise no readline capabilites will be compiled.

  Configuring ntp

    Config Files

   /etc/ntp.conf

    Configuration Information

   The following configuration file first defines various ntp servers with
   open access from different continents. Second, it creates a drift file
   where ntpd stores the frequency offset and a pid file to store the ntpd

   file /etc/ntp.leapseconds, that the update-leap script checks and updates,
   when necessary. This script can be run as a cron job and the ntp
   developers recommend a frequency of about three weeks for the updates.
   Since the documentation included with the package is sparse, visit the ntp

    Synchronizing the Time

   There are two options. Option one is to run ntpd continuously and allow it
   to synchronize the time in a gradual manner. The other option is to run
   ntpd periodically (using cron) and update the time each time ntpd is
   scheduled.

   If you choose Option one, then install the /etc/rc.d/init.d/ntp init
   script included in the blfs-bootscripts-20190609 package.

 make install-ntpd

   If you prefer to run ntpd periodically, add the following command to
   root's crontab:

 ntpd -q

   Execute the following command if you would like to set the hardware clock
   to the current system time at shutdown and reboot:

 ln -v -sf ../init.d/setclock /etc/rc.d/rc0.d/K46setclock &&
 ln -v -sf ../init.d/setclock /etc/rc.d/rc6.d/K46setclock

   The other way around is already set up by LFS.

    Short Descriptions

   calc_tickadj calculates optimal value for tick given ntp drift file.       
   ntp-keygen   generates cryptographic data files used by the NTPv4          
                authentication and identification schemes.                    
   ntp-wait     is useful at boot time, to delay the boot sequence until ntpd 
                has set the time.                                             
   ntpd         is a ntp daemon that runs in the background and keeps the     
                date and time synchronized based on response from configured  
                ntp servers. It also functions as a ntp server.               
   ntpdate      is a client program that sets the date and time based on the  
                response from an ntp server. This command is deprecated.      
   ntpdc        is used to query the ntp daemon about its current state and   
                to request changes in that state.                             
   ntpq         is a utility program used to monitor ntpd operations and      
                determine performance.                                        
   ntptime      reads and displays time-related kernel variables.             
   ntptrace     traces a chain of ntp servers back to the primary source.     
   sntp         is a Simple Network Time Protocol (SNTP) client.              
   tickadj      reads, and optionally modifies, several timekeeping-related   
                variables in older kernels that do not have support for       
                precision timekeeping.                                        
   update-leap  is a script to verify and, if necessary, update the           
                leap-second definition file.

   User Notes: http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/rpcbind

  Installation of rpcbind

   In order to get rpcbind to work properly, first fix the package to use
   correct service name:

 sed -i "/servname/s:rpcbind:sunrpc:" src/rpcbind.c

   Install rpcbind by running the following commands:

 patch -Np1 -i ../rpcbind-1.2.5-vulnerability_fixes-1.patch &&

 ./configure --prefix=/usr                                  \
             --bindir=/sbin                                 \
             --sbindir=/sbin                                \
             --with-rpcuser=root                            \
             --enable-warmstarts                            \
             --without-systemdsystemunitdir                 &&
 make

   This package does not come with a test suite.

   Now, as the root user:

 make install

  Command Explanations

   --with-rpcuser=root: This works around an error in the configure script.

   --without-systemdsystemunitdir: This version of BLFS does not support
   systemd.

  Configuring rpcbind

    Boot Script

   Install the /etc/rc.d/init.d/rpcbind init script included in the
   blfs-bootscripts-20190609 package.

 make install-rpcbind

   Installed Program: rpcbind and rpcinfo
   Installed Libraries: None
   Installed Directories: None

    Short Descriptions

   rpcbind is a server that converts RPC program numbers into universal       
           addresses. It must be running on the host to be able to make RPC   
           calls on a server on that machine.                                 
   rpcinfo makes an RPC call to an RPC server and reports data according to   
           the requested options.

   popt-1.16

   User Notes: http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/rsync

  Installation of rsync

   For security reasons, running the rsync server as an unprivileged user and
   group is encouraged. If you intend to run rsync as a daemon, create the
   rsyncd user and group with the following commands issued by the root user:

 groupadd -g 48 rsyncd &&
 useradd -c "rsyncd Daemon" -d /home/rsync -g rsyncd \
     -s /bin/false -u 48 rsyncd

   Install rsync by running the following commands:

 ./configure --prefix=/usr --without-included-zlib &&
 make

   If you have Doxygen-1.8.16 installed and wish to build HTML API
   documentation, issue:

 doxygen

   To test the results, issue: make check.

   Now, as the root user:

 make install

   If you built the documentation, install it using the following commands as
   the root user:

 install -v -m755 -d          /usr/share/doc/rsync-3.1.3/api &&
 install -v -m644 dox/html/*  /usr/share/doc/rsync-3.1.3/api

  Command Explanations

   --without-included-zlib: This switch enables compilation with
   system-installed zlib library.

  Configuring rsync

    Config Files

   /etc/rsyncd.conf

    Configuration Information

   For client access to remote files, you may need to install the
   OpenSSH-8.0p1 package to connect to the remote server.

   This is a simple download-only configuration to set up running rsync as a
   server. See the rsyncd.conf(5) man-page for additional options (i.e., user
   authentication).

 cat > /etc/rsyncd.conf << "EOF"
 # This is a basic rsync configuration file
 # It exports a single module without user authentication.

 motd file = /home/rsync/welcome.msg
 use chroot = yes

 [localhost]
     path = /home/rsync
     comment = Default rsync module
     read only = yes
     list = yes
     uid = rsyncd
     gid = rsyncd
 EOF

   You can find additional configuration information and general
   documentation about rsync at http://rsync.samba.org/documentation.html.

    Boot Script

   Note that you only want to start the rsync server if you want to provide
   an rsync archive on your local machine. You don't need this script to run
   the rsync client.

   Install the /etc/rc.d/init.d/rsyncd init script included in the
   blfs-bootscripts-20190609 package.

 make install-rsyncd

   Installed Program: rsync
   Installed Libraries: None
   Installed Directories: Optionally, /usr/share/doc/rsync-3.1.3

    Short Descriptions

   rsync is a replacement for rcp (and scp) that has many more features. It   
         uses the ârsync algorithmâ which provides a very fast method of      
         syncing remote files. It does this by sending just the differences   
         in the files across the link, without requiring that both sets of    
         files are present at one end of the link beforehand.

Samba-4.10.7

  Introduction to Samba

   The Samba package provides file and print services to SMB/CIFS clients and
   Windows networking to Linux clients. Samba can also be configured as a
   Windows Domain Controller replacement, a file/print server acting as a
   member of a Windows Active Directory domain and a NetBIOS (rfc1001/1002)
   nameserver (which among other things provides LAN browsing support).

   This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS-9.0

  Installation of Samba

   Fix a test that always fails:

 echo "^samba4.rpc.echo.*on.*ncacn_np.*with.*object.*nt4_dc" >> selftest/knownfail

   Install Samba by running the following commands:

 CFLAGS="-I/usr/include/tirpc"          \
 LDFLAGS="-ltirpc"                      \
 ./configure                            \
     --prefix=/usr                      \
     --sysconfdir=/etc                  \
     --localstatedir=/var               \
     --with-piddir=/run/samba           \
     --with-pammodulesdir=/lib/security \
     --enable-fhs                       \
     --without-ad-dc                    \
     --without-systemd                  \
     --enable-selftest                  &&
 make

   To test the results, as the root user, issue: make quicktest. The test
   suite will produce lines that look like failures, but these are innocuous.
   The last few lines of output should report "ALL OK" for a good test run. A
   summary of any failures can be found in ./st/summary.

  Note

   Additionally, developer test suites are available. If you've installed the
   optional python modules above, you can run these tests with make test. It
   is not recommended for the average builder at around 290 SBU and over a
   gigabyte of disk space, and you should expect ~73 errors and ~30 failures
   from the 3000+ tests.

   Now, as the root user:

 make install &&

 mv -v /usr/lib/libnss_win{s,bind}.so*   /lib                       &&
 ln -v -sf ../../lib/libnss_winbind.so.2 /usr/lib/libnss_winbind.so &&
 ln -v -sf ../../lib/libnss_wins.so.2    /usr/lib/libnss_wins.so    &&

 install -v -m644    examples/smb.conf.default /etc/samba &&

 mkdir -pv /etc/openldap/schema                        &&

 install -v -m644    examples/LDAP/README              \
                     /etc/openldap/schema/README.LDAP  &&

 install -v -m644    examples/LDAP/samba*              \
                     /etc/openldap/schema              &&

 install -v -m755    examples/LDAP/{get*,ol*} \
                     /etc/openldap/schema

  Command Explanations

   --enable-fhs: Assigns all other file paths in a manner compliant with the
   Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS).

   --without-systemd: Disable systemd integration, since it is not built in
   the System V version of LFS/BLFS.

   --without-ad-dc: Disable Active Directory Domain Controller functionality.
   See Setup a Samba Active Directory Domain Controller for detailed
   information. Remove this switch if you've installed the Python modules
   needed for ADS support. Note that BLFS does not provide a samba bootscript
   for an Active Directory domain controller.

   --with-selftest-prefix=SELFTEST_PREFIX: This option specifies the test
   suite work directory (default=./st).

   mv -v /usr/lib/libnss_win{s,bind}.so* /lib: The nss libraries are
   installed in /usr/lib by default. Move them to /lib.

   ln -v -sf ../../lib/libnss_winbind.so.2 /usr/lib/libnss_winbind.so and ln
   -v -sf ../../lib/libnss_wins.so.2 /usr/lib/libnss_wins.so: These symlinks
   are required when applications build against these libraries.

   install -v -m644 examples/LDAP/* /etc/openldap/schema: These commands are
   used to copy sample Samba schemas to the OpenLDAP schema directory.

   install -v -m644 ../examples/smb.conf.default /etc/samba: This copies a
   default smb.conf file into /etc/samba. This sample configuration will not
   work until you copy it to /etc/samba/smb.conf and make the appropriate
   changes for your installation. See the configuration section for minimum
   values which must be set.

  Configuring Samba

    Config Files

   /etc/samba/smb.conf

    Printing to SMB Clients

   If you use CUPS for print services, and you wish to print to a printer
   attached to an SMB client, you need to create an SMB backend device. To
   create the device, issue the following command as the root user:

 ln -v -sf /usr/bin/smbspool /usr/lib/cups/backend/smb

    Configuration Information

   Due to the complexity and the many various uses for Samba, complete
   configuration for all the package's capabilities is well beyond the scope
   of the BLFS book. This section provides instructions to configure the
   /etc/samba/smb.conf file for two common scenarios. The complete contents
   of /etc/samba/smb.conf will depend on the purpose of Samba installation.

  Note

   You may find it easier to copy the configuration parameters shown below
   into an empty /etc/samba/smb.conf file instead of copying and editing the
   default file as mentioned in the âCommand Explanationsâ section. How you
   create/edit the /etc/samba/smb.conf file will be left up to you. Do ensure
   the file is only writeable by the root user (mode 644).

      Scenario 1: Minimal Standalone Client-Only Installation

   Choose this variant if you only want to transfer files using smbclient,
   mount Windows shares and print to Windows printers, and don't want to
   share your files and printers to Windows machines.

   A /etc/samba/smb.conf file with the following three parameters is
   sufficient:

 [global]
     workgroup = MYGROUP
     dos charset = cp850
     unix charset = ISO-8859-1

   The values in this example specify that the computer belongs to a Windows
   workgroup named âMYGROUPâ, uses the âcp850â character set on the wire when
   talking to MS-DOS and MS Windows 9x, and that the filenames are stored in
   the âISO-8859-1â encoding on the disk. Adjust these values appropriately
   for your installation. The âunix charsetâ value must be the same as the
   output of locale charmap when executed with the LANG variable set to your
   preferred locale, otherwise the ls command may not display correct
   filenames of downloaded files.

   There is no need to run any Samba servers in this scenario, thus you don't
   need to install the provided bootscripts.

      Scenario 2: Standalone File/Print Server

   Choose this variant if you want to share your files and printers to
   Windows machines in your workgroup in addition to the capabilities
   described in Scenario 1.

   In this case, the /etc/samba/smb.conf.default file may be a good template
   to start from. Also add âdos charsetâ and âunix charsetâ parameters to the
   â[global]â section as described in Scenario 1 in order to prevent filename
   corruption. For security reasons, you may wish to define path =
   /home/alice/shared-files, assuming your user name is alice and you only
   want to share the files in that directory, instead of your entire home.
   Then, replace homes by shared-files and change also the âcommentâ if used
   the configuration file below or the /etc/samba/smb.conf.default to create
   yours.

   The following configuration file creates a separate share for each user's
   home directory and also makes all printers available to Windows machines:

 [global]
     workgroup = MYGROUP
     dos charset = cp850
     unix charset = ISO-8859-1

 [homes]
     comment = Home Directories
     browseable = no
     writable = yes

 [printers]
     comment = All Printers
     path = /var/spool/samba
     browseable = no
     guest ok = no
     printable = yes

   Other parameters you may wish to customize in the â[global]â section
   include:

     server string =
     security =
     hosts allow =
     load printers =
     log file =
     max log size =
     socket options =
     local master =

   Reference the comments in the /etc/samba/smb.conf.default file for
   information regarding these parameters.

   Since the smbd and nmbd daemons are needed in this case, install the samba
   bootscript. Be sure to run smbpasswd (with the -a option to add users) to
   enable and set passwords for all accounts that need Samba access. Using
   the default Samba passdb backend, any user you attempt to add will also be
   required to exist in the /etc/passwd file.

      Advanced Requirements

   More complex scenarios involving domain control or membership are
   possible. Such setups are advanced topics and cannot be adequately covered
   in BLFS. Many complete books have been written on these topics alone. Note
   that in some domain membership scenarios, the winbindd daemon and the
   corresponding bootscript are needed.

   There is quite a bit of documentation available which covers many of these
   advanced configurations. Point your web browser to the links below to view
   some of the documentation included with the Samba package:

     * Using Samba, 2nd Edition; a popular book published by O'Reilly
       http://www.samba.org/samba/docs/using_samba/toc.html

     * The Official Samba HOWTO and Reference Guide
       http://www.samba.org/samba/docs/man/Samba-HOWTO-Collection/

     * Samba-3 by Example http://www.samba.org/samba/docs/man/Samba-Guide/

      Guest account

   The default Samba installation uses the nobody user for guest access to
   the server. This can be overridden by setting the guest account =
   parameter in the /etc/samba/smb.conf file. If you utilize the guest

      Boot Script

   For your convenience, boot scripts have been provided for Samba. There are
   two included in the blfs-bootscripts-20190609 package. The first, samba,
   will start the smbd and nmbd daemons needed to provide SMB/CIFS services.
   The second script, winbind, starts the winbindd daemon, used for providing
   Windows domain services to Linux clients.

Wireless Tools-29

  Introduction to Wireless Tools

   The Wireless Extension (WE) is a generic API in the Linux kernel allowing
   a driver to expose configuration and statistics specific to common
   Wireless LANs to user space. A single set of tools can support all the
   variations of Wireless LANs, regardless of their type as long as the
   driver supports Wireless Extensions. WE parameters may also be changed on
   the fly without restarting the driver (or Linux).

   The Wireless Tools (WT) package is a set of tools allowing manipulation of
   the Wireless Extensions. They use a textual interface to support the full
   Wireless Extension.

   This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS-9.0
   platform.

    Package Information

     * Download (HTTP):
       https://hewlettpackard.github.io/wireless-tools/wireless_tools.29.tar.gz

     * Download MD5 sum: e06c222e186f7cc013fd272d023710cb

     * Download size: 288 KB

     * Estimated disk space required: 2.0 MB

     * Estimated build time: less than 0.1 SBU

    Additional Downloads

     * Required patch:
       http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/patches/blfs/9.0/wireless_tools-29-fix_iwlist_scanning-1.patch

   User Notes: http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/WirelessTools

  Kernel Configuration

   To use Wireless Tools, the kernel must have the appropriate drivers and
   other support available. The appropriate bus must also be available. For
   many laptops, the PCMCIA bus (CONFIG_PCCARD) needs to be built. In some
   cases, this bus support will also need to be built for embedded wireless
   cards. The appropriate bridge support also needs to be built. For many
   modern laptops, the CardBus host bridge (CONFIG_YENTA) will be needed.

   In addition to the bus, the actual driver for the specific wireless card
   must also be available. There are many wireless cards and they don't all
   work with Linux. The first place to look for card support is the kernel.
   The drivers are located in Device Drivers â Network Device Support â
   Wireless LAN (non-hamradio). There are also external drivers available for
   some very common cards. For more information, look at the user notes.

   After the correct drivers are loaded, the interface will appear in
   /proc/net/wireless.

  Installation of Wireless Tools

   First, apply a patch that fixes a problem when numerous networks are
   available:

 patch -Np1 -i ../wireless_tools-29-fix_iwlist_scanning-1.patch

   To install Wireless Tools, use the following commands:

 make

   This package does not come with a test suite.

   Now, as the root user:

 make PREFIX=/usr INSTALL_MAN=/usr/share/man install

  Command Explanations

   INSTALL_MAN=/usr/share/man: Install manual pages in /usr/share/man instead
   of /usr/man

  Contents

   Installed Programs: ifrename, iwconfig, iwevent, iwgetid, iwlist, iwpriv,
   and iwspy
   Installed Library: libiw.so
   Installed Directories: None

    Short Descriptions

   ifrename renames network interfaces based on various static criteria.      
   iwconfig configures a wireless network interface.                          
   iwevent  displays wireless events generated by drivers and setting         
            changes.                                                          
   iwgetid  reports ESSID, NWID or AP/Cell Address of wireless networks.      
   iwlist   gets detailed wireless information from a wireless interface.     
   iwpriv   configures optional (private) parameters of a wireless network    
            interface.                                                        
   iwspy    gets wireless statistics from specific node.                      
   libiw.so contains functions required by the wireless programs and provides 
            an API for other programs.

   for the explanation of the following options as well as other options that
   can be used. Create a build configuration file that should work for
   standard WiFi setups by running the following command:

 cat > wpa_supplicant/.config << "EOF"
 CONFIG_BACKEND=file
 CONFIG_CTRL_IFACE=y
 CONFIG_DEBUG_FILE=y
 CONFIG_DEBUG_SYSLOG=y
 CONFIG_DEBUG_SYSLOG_FACILITY=LOG_DAEMON
 CONFIG_DRIVER_NL80211=y
 CONFIG_DRIVER_WEXT=y
 CONFIG_DRIVER_WIRED=y
 CONFIG_EAP_GTC=y
 CONFIG_EAP_LEAP=y
 CONFIG_EAP_MD5=y
 CONFIG_EAP_MSCHAPV2=y
 CONFIG_EAP_OTP=y
 CONFIG_EAP_PEAP=y
 CONFIG_EAP_TLS=y
 CONFIG_EAP_TTLS=y
 CONFIG_IEEE8021X_EAPOL=y
 CONFIG_IPV6=y
 CONFIG_LIBNL32=y
 CONFIG_PEERKEY=y
 CONFIG_PKCS12=y
 CONFIG_READLINE=y
 CONFIG_SMARTCARD=y
 CONFIG_WPS=y
 CFLAGS += -I/usr/include/libnl3
 EOF

   If you wish to use WPA Supplicant with NetworkManager-1.20.0, make sure
   that you have installed dbus-1.12.16 and libxml2-2.9.9, then add the
   following options to the WPA Supplicant build configuration file by
   running the following command:

 cat >> wpa_supplicant/.config << "EOF"
 CONFIG_CTRL_IFACE_DBUS=y
 CONFIG_CTRL_IFACE_DBUS_NEW=y
 CONFIG_CTRL_IFACE_DBUS_INTRO=y
 EOF

   Install WPA Supplicant by running the following commands:

 cd wpa_supplicant &&
 make BINDIR=/sbin LIBDIR=/lib

   If you have installed Qt-5.13.0 and wish to build the WPA Supplicant GUI
   program, run the following commands:

  Note

   The following directory name is labelled qt4, but is compatible with
   Qt-5.13.0.

 pushd wpa_gui-qt4 &&
 qmake wpa_gui.pro &&
 make &&
 popd

   This package does not come with a test suite.

   Now, as the root user:

 install -v -m755 wpa_{cli,passphrase,supplicant} /sbin/ &&
 install -v -m644 doc/docbook/wpa_supplicant.conf.5 /usr/share/man/man5/ &&
 install -v -m644 doc/docbook/wpa_{cli,passphrase,supplicant}.8 /usr/share/man/man8/

   If you have built WPA Supplicant with D-Bus support, you will need to
   install D-Bus configuration files. Install them by running the following
   commands as the root user:

 install -v -m644 dbus/fi.w1.wpa_supplicant1.service \
                  /usr/share/dbus-1/system-services/ &&
 install -v -d -m755 /etc/dbus-1/system.d &&
 install -v -m644 dbus/dbus-wpa_supplicant.conf \
                  /etc/dbus-1/system.d/wpa_supplicant.conf

   If you have built the WPA Supplicant GUI program, install it by running
   the following commands as the root user:

 install -v -m755 wpa_gui-qt4/wpa_gui /usr/bin/ &&
 install -v -m644 doc/docbook/wpa_gui.8 /usr/share/man/man8/ &&
 install -v -m644 wpa_gui-qt4/wpa_gui.desktop /usr/share/applications/ &&
 install -v -m644 wpa_gui-qt4/icons/wpa_gui.svg /usr/share/pixmaps/

  Note

   You will need to restart the system D-Bus daemon before you can use the
   WPA Supplicant D-Bus interface.

  Note

   This package installs desktop files into the /usr/share/applications
   hierarchy and you can improve system performance and memory usage by
   updating /usr/share/applications/mimeinfo.cache. To perform the update you
   must have desktop-file-utils-0.24 installed and issue the following
   command as the root user:

 update-desktop-database -q

  Configuring wpa_supplicant

    Config File

   /etc/sysconfig/wpa_supplicant-*.conf

    Configuration Information

   To connect to an access point that uses a password, you need to put the
   pre-shared key in /etc/sysconfig/wpa_supplicant-wifi0.conf. SSID is the
   string that the access point/router transmits to identify itself. Run the
   following command as the root user:

 wpa_passphrase SSID SECRET_PASSWORD > /etc/sysconfig/wpa_supplicant-wifi0.conf

   /etc/sysconfig/wpa_supplicant-wifi0.conf can hold the details of several
   access points. When wpa_supplicant is started, it will scan for the SSIDs
   it can see and choose the appropriate password to connect.

   If you want to connect to an access point that isn't password protected,
   put an entry like this in /etc/sysconfig/wpa_supplicant-wifi0.conf .
   Replace "Some-SSID" with the SSID of the access point/router.

 network={
   ssid="Some-SSID"
   key_mgmt=NONE
 }

   Connecting to a new access point that is not in the configuration file can
   be accomplished manually via the command line or GUI, but it must be done
   via a privileged user. To do that, add the following to the configuration
   file:

 ctrl_interface=DIR=/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=<privileged group>
 update_config=1

   Replace the <privileged group> above with a system group where members
   have the ability to connect to a wireless access point.

   There are many options that you could use to tweak how you connect to each
   access point. They are described in some detail in the
   wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf file in the source tree.

    Connecting to an Access Point

   If you want to configure network interfaces at boot using wpa_supplicant,
   you need to install the /lib/services/wpa script included in
   blfs-bootscripts-20190609 package:

 make install-service-wpa

   If your router/access point uses DHCP to allocate IP addresses, you can
   install DHCP-4.4.1 client and use it to automatically obtain network
   addresses. Create the /etc/sysconfig/ifconfig-wifi0 by running the
   following command as the root user:

 cat > /etc/sysconfig/ifconfig.wifi0 << "EOF"
 ONBOOT="yes"
 IFACE="wlan0"
 SERVICE="wpa"

 # Additional arguments to wpa_supplicant
 WPA_ARGS=""

 WPA_SERVICE="dhclient"
 DHCP_START=""
 DHCP_STOP=""

 # Set PRINTIP="yes" to have the script print
 # the DHCP assigned IP address
 PRINTIP="no"

 # Set PRINTALL="yes" to print the DHCP assigned values for
 # IP, SM, DG, and 1st NS. This requires PRINTIP="yes".
 PRINTALL="no"
 EOF

   If you prefer dhcpcd-8.0.3 instead of DHCP-4.4.1 client, then create the
   /etc/sysconfig/ifconfig-wifi0 by running the following command as the root
   user:

 cat > /etc/sysconfig/ifconfig.wifi0 << "EOF"
 ONBOOT="yes"
 IFACE="wlan0"
 SERVICE="wpa"

 # Additional arguments to wpa_supplicant
 WPA_ARGS=""

 WPA_SERVICE="dhcpcd"
 DHCP_START="-b -q <insert appropriate start options here>"
 DHCP_STOP="-k <insert additional stop options here>"
 EOF

   Alternatively, if you use static addresses on your local network, then
   create the /etc/sysconfig/ifconfig-wifi0 by running the following command
   as the root user:

 cat > /etc/sysconfig/ifconfig.wifi0 << "EOF"
 ONBOOT="yes"
 IFACE="wlan0"
 SERVICE="wpa"

 # Additional arguments to wpa_supplicant
 WPA_ARGS=""

 WPA_SERVICE="ipv4-static"
 IP="192.168.1.1"
 GATEWAY="192.168.1.2"
 PREFIX="24"
 BROADCAST="192.168.1.255"
 EOF

   You can connect to the wireless access point by running the following
   command as the root user:

 ifup wifi0

   Replace wlan0 with the correct wireless interface and wifi0 with desired
   name for the configuration file. Please note that wpa_supplicant-*.conf
   and ifconfig.* configuration files need to have identical names, ie both
   contain wifi0 in their name.

   wish to install the examples.

  Configuring NetworkManager

    Config Files

   /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf

    Configuration Information

   For NetworkManager to work, at least a minimal configuration file must be
   present. Such file is not installed with make install. Issue the following
   command as the root user to create minimal NetworkManager.conf file:

 cat >> /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf << "EOF"
 [main]
 plugins=keyfile
 EOF

   This file should not be modified directly by users of the system. Instead,
   system specific changes should be made using configuration files in the
   /etc/NetworkManager/conf.d direcotry.

   To allow polkit to manage authorizations, add the following configuration
   file:

 cat > /etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/polkit.conf << "EOF"
 [main]
 auth-polkit=true
 EOF

   To use something other than the built-in dhcp client (recommended if using
   only nmcli), use the following configuration (valid values are dhclient,
   dhcpcd, and internal):

 cat > /etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/dhcp.conf << "EOF"
 [main]
 dhcp=dhclient
 EOF

   To prevent NetworkManager from updating the /etc/resolv.conf file, add the
   following configuration file:

 cat > /etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/no-dns-update.conf << "EOF"
 [main]
 dns=none
 EOF

   For additional configuation options, see man 5 NetworkManager.conf.

   To allow regular users permission to configure network connections, you
   should add them to the netdev group, and create a polkit rule that grants
   access. Run the following commands as the root user:

 groupadd -fg 86 netdev &&
 /usr/sbin/usermod -a -G netdev <username>

 cat > /usr/share/polkit-1/rules.d/org.freedesktop.NetworkManager.rules << "EOF"
 polkit.addRule(function(action, subject) {
     if (action.id.indexOf("org.freedesktop.NetworkManager.") == 0 && subject.isInGroup("netdev")) {
         return polkit.Result.YES;
     }
 });
 EOF

    Boot Script

   To automatically start the NetworkManager daemon when the system is
   rebooted, install the /etc/rc.d/init.d/networkmanagerbootscript from the
   blfs-bootscripts-20190609 package.

  Note

   If using Network Manager to manage an interface, any previous
   configuration for that interface should be removed, and the interface
   brought down prior to starting Network Manager.

Traceroute-2.1.0

  Introduction to Traceroute

   The Traceroute package contains a program which is used to display the
   network route that packets take to reach a specified host. This is a
   standard network troubleshooting tool. If you find yourself unable to
   connect to another system, traceroute can help pinpoint the problem.

  Note

   This package overwrites the version of traceroute that was installed in
   the inetutils package in LFS. This version is more powerful and allows
   many more options than the standard version.

   This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS-9.0
   platform.

 rm -fv /usr/share/man/man1/traceroute.1

   The traceroute.1 file that was installed in LFS by inetutils is no longer
   relevant. This package overwrites that version of traceroute and installs
   the man page in man chapter 8.

  Contents

   Installed Program: traceroute and traceroute6 (symlink)
   Installed Libraries: None
   Installed Directories: None

    Short Descriptions

   traceroute  does basically what it says: it traces the route your packets  
               take from the host you are working on to another host on a     
               network, showing all the intermediate hops (gateways) along    
               the way.                                                       
   traceroute6 is equivalent to traceroute -6.

Wireshark-3.0.3

  Introduction to Wireshark

   The Wireshark package contains a network protocol analyzer, also known as
   a âsnifferâ. This is useful for analyzing data captured âoff the wireâ
   from a live network connection, or data read from a capture file.

   Wireshark provides both a graphical and a TTY-mode front-end for examining
   captured network packets from over 500 protocols, as well as the
   capability to read capture files from many other popular network
   analyzers.

   This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS-9.0
   platform.

   User Notes: http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/wireshark

  Kernel Configuration

   The kernel must have the Packet protocol enabled for Wireshark to capture
   live packets from the network:

 [*] Networking support --->          [CONFIG_NET]
       Networking options --->
         <*/M> Packet socket          [CONFIG_PACKET]

   If built as a module, the name is af_packet.ko.

  Installation of Wireshark

   Wireshark is a very large and complex application. These instructions
   provide additional security measures to ensure that only trusted users are
   allowed to view network traffic. First, set up a system group for
   wireshark. As the root user:

 groupadd -g 62 wireshark

   Continue to install Wireshark by running the following commands:

 mkdir build &&
 cd    build &&

 cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr \
       -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release  \
       -DCMAKE_INSTALL_DOCDIR=/usr/share/doc/wireshark-3.0.3 \
       -G Ninja \
       .. &&
 ninja

   This package does not come with a test suite.

   Now, as the root user:

 ninja install &&

 install -v -m755 -d /usr/share/doc/wireshark-3.0.3 &&
 install -v -m644    ../README.linux ../doc/README.* ../doc/{*.pod,randpkt.txt} \
                     /usr/share/doc/wireshark-3.0.3 &&

 pushd /usr/share/doc/wireshark-3.0.3 &&
    for FILENAME in ../../wireshark/*.html; do
       ln -s -v -f $FILENAME .
    done &&
 popd
 unset FILENAME

   If you downloaded any of the documentation files from the page listed in
   the 'Additional Downloads', install them by issuing the following commands
   as the root user:

 install -v -m644 <Downloaded_Files> \
                  /usr/share/doc/wireshark-3.0.3

   Now, set ownership and permissions of sensitive applications to only allow
   authorized users. As the root user:

 chown -v root:wireshark /usr/bin/{tshark,dumpcap} &&
 chmod -v 6550 /usr/bin/{tshark,dumpcap}

   Finally, add any users to the wireshark group (as root user):

 usermod -a -G wireshark <username>

   If you are installing wireshark for the first time, it will be necessary
   to leave the session and login again, thus you will now have wireshark
   between your groups, otherwise, it will not run properly.

  Configuring Wireshark

    Config Files

   /etc/wireshark.conf and ~/.config/wireshark/* (unless there is already
   ~/.wireshark/* in the system)

    Configuration Information

   Though the default configuration parameters are very sane, reference the
   configuration section of the Wireshark User's Guide for configuration
   information. Most of Wireshark's configuration can be accomplished using
   the menu options of the wireshark graphical interfaces.

  Note

   If you want to look at packets, make sure you don't filter them out with
   Iptables-1.8.3. If you want to exclude certain classes of packets, it is
   more efficient to do it with iptables than it is with Wireshark.

  Contents

   Installed Programs: capinfos, captype, dumpcap, editcap, idl2wrs,
   mergecap, randpkt, rawshark, reordercap, sharkd, text2pcap, tshark, and
   wireshark
   Installed Libraries: libwireshark.so, libwiretap.so, libwscodecs.so,
   libwsutil.so, and numerous modules under /usr/lib/wireshark/plugins
   Installed Directories: /usr/{include,lib,share}/wireshark and
   /usr/share/doc/wireshark-3.0.3

    Short Descriptions

   capinfos        reads a saved capture file and returns any or all of       
                   several statistics about that file. It is able to detect   
                   and read any capture supported by the Wireshark package.   
   captype         prints the file types of capture files.                    
   dumpcap         is a network traffic dump tool. It lets you capture packet 
                   data from a live network and write the packets to a file.  
   editcap         edits and/or translates the format of capture files. It    
                   knows how to read libpcap capture files, including those   
                   of tcpdump, Wireshark and other tools that write captures  
                   in that format.                                            
   idl2wrs         is a program that takes a user specified CORBA IDL file    
                   and generates âCâ source code for a Wireshark âpluginâ. It 
                   relies on two Python programs wireshark_be.py and          
                   wireshark_gen.py, which are not installed by default. They 
                   have to be copied manually from the tools directory to the 
                   $PYTHONPATH/site-packages/ directory.                      
   mergecap        combines multiple saved capture files into a single output 
                   file.                                                      
   randpkt         creates random-packet capture files.                       
   rawshark        dump and analyze raw libpcap data.                         
   reordercap      reorder timestamps of input file frames into output file.  
   sharkd          is a daemon that listens on UNIX sockets.                  
   text2pcap       reads in an ASCII hex dump and writes the data described   
                   into a libpcap-style capture file.                         
   tshark          is a TTY-mode network protocol analyzer. It lets you       
                   capture packet data from a live network or read packets    
                   from a previously saved capture file.                      
   wireshark       is the Qt GUI network protocol analyzer. It lets you       
                   interactively browse packet data from a live network or    
                   from a previously saved capture file.                      
   wireshark-gtk   is the Gtk+ GUI network protocol analyzer. It lets you     
                   interactively browse packet data from a live network or    
                   from a previously saved capture file (optional).           
   libwireshark.so contains functions used by the Wireshark programs to       
                   perform filtering and packet capturing.                    
   libwiretap.so   is a library being developed as a future replacement for

   slow the tests down and may cause failures.)

   User Notes: http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/curl

  Installation of cURL

   Install cURL by running the following commands:

 ./configure --prefix=/usr                           \
             --disable-static                        \
             --enable-threaded-resolver              \
             --with-ca-path=/etc/ssl/certs &&
 make

   To run the test suite, issue: make test. Tests 323 and 1560 are known to
   fail. A few other tests may fail randomly for unknown reasons.

   Now, as the root user:

 make install &&

 rm -rf docs/examples/.deps &&

 find docs \( -name Makefile\* -o -name \*.1 -o -name \*.3 \) -exec rm {} \; &&

 install -v -d -m755 /usr/share/doc/curl-7.65.3 &&
 cp -v -R docs/*     /usr/share/doc/curl-7.65.3

   Simple tests to the new installed curl: curl --trace-ascii debugdump.txt
   http://www.example.com/ and curl --trace-ascii d.txt --trace-time
   http://example.com/. Inspect the locally created trace files debugdump.txt
   and d.txt, which contain version downloaded files information, etc. One
   file has the time for each action logged.

  Command Explanations

   --disable-static: This switch prevents installation of static versions of
   the libraries.

   --enable-threaded-resolver: This switch enables cURL's builtin threaded
   DNS resolver.

   --with-ca-path=/etc/ssl/certs: This switch sets the location of the BLFS
   Certificate Authority store.

   --with-gssapi: This parameter adds Kerberos 5 support to libcurl.

   --without-ssl --with-gnutls: Use to build with GnuTLS support instead of
   OpenSSL for SSL/TLS.

   --with-ca-bundle=/etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt: Use this switch instead
   of --with-ca-path if building with GnuTLS support instead of OpenSSL for
   SSL/TLS.

   --with-libssh2: This paramater adds SSH support to cURL. This is disabled
   by default.

   --enable-ares: This paramater adds support for DNS resolution through the
   c-ares library. It is disabled by default, but does speed up DNS
   resolution queries.

   find docs ... -exec rm {} \;: This command removes Makefiles and man files
   from the documentation directory that would otherwise be installed by the
   commands that follow.

Chapter 18. Text Web Browsers

   People who are new to Unix-based systems tend to ask the question "Why on
   earth would I want a text-mode browser? I'm going to compile X and use
   Konqueror/Mozilla/Whatever!". Those who have been around systems for a
   while know that when (not if) you manage to mess up your graphical browser
   install and you need to look up some information on the web, a console
   based browser will save you. Also, there are quite a few people who prefer
   to use one of these browsers as their primary method of browsing; either
   to avoid the clutter and bandwidth which accompanies images or because
   they may use a text-to-speech synthesizer which can read the page to them
   (of use for instance to partially sighted or blind users). In this chapter
   you will find installation instructions for three console web browsers:

   User Notes: http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/Lynx

  Installation of Lynx

   Install Lynx by running the following commands:

 ./configure --prefix=/usr          \
             --sysconfdir=/etc/lynx \
             --datadir=/usr/share/doc/lynx-2.8.9rel.1 \
             --with-zlib            \
             --with-bzlib           \
             --with-ssl             \
             --with-screen=ncursesw \
             --enable-locale-charset &&
 make

   This package does not come with a test suite.

   Now, as the root user:

 make install-full &&
 chgrp -v -R root /usr/share/doc/lynx-2.8.9rel.1/lynx_doc

  Command Explanations

   --sysconfdir=/etc/lynx: This parameter is used so that the configuration
   files are located in /etc/lynx instead of /usr/etc.

   --datadir=/usr/share/doc/lynx-2.8.9rel.1: This parameter is used so that
   the documentation files are installed into /usr/share/doc/lynx-2.8.9rel.1
   instead of /usr/share/lynx_{doc,help}.

   --with-zlib: This enables support for linking libz into Lynx.

   --with-bzlib: This enables support for linking libbz2 into Lynx.

   --with-ssl: This enables support for linking SSL into Lynx.

   --with-screen=ncursesw: This switch enables the use of advanced
   wide-character support present in the system NCurses library. This is
   needed for proper display of characters and line wrapping in multibyte
   locales.

   --enable-locale-charset: This switch allows Lynx to deduce the proper
   character encoding for terminal output from the current locale. A
   configuration step is still needed (see below), but unlike the situation
   without this switch, the configuration step becomes the same for all users
   (without the switch one must specify the display character set
   explicitly). This is important for environments such as a LiveCD, where
   the amount of system-specific configuration steps has to be reduced to the
   minimum.

   --enable-nls: This switch allows Lynx to print translated messages (such
   as questions about cookies and SSL certificates).

   --with-gnutls: This enables experimental support for linking GnuTLS into
   Lynx. Remove the --with-ssl switch if you want to use gnutls.

   make install-full: In addition to the standard installation, this target
   installs the documentation and help files.

   chgrp -v -R root /usr/share/doc/lynx-2.8.9rel.1/lynx_doc: This command
   corrects the improper group ownership of installed documentation files.

  Configuring Lynx

    Config Files

   /etc/lynx/lynx.cfg

    Configuration Information

   The proper way to get the display character set is to examine the current
   locale. However, Lynx does not do this by default. As the root user,
   change this setting:

 sed -e '/#LOCALE/     a LOCALE_CHARSET:TRUE'     \
     -i /etc/lynx/lynx.cfg

   The built-in editor in Lynx Breaks Multibyte Characters. This issue
   manifests itself in multibyte locales, e.g., as the Backspace key not
   erasing non-ASCII characters properly, and as incorrect data being sent to
   the network when one edits the contents of text areas. The only solution
   to this problem is to configure Lynx to use an external editor (bound to
   the âCtrl+X eâ key combination by default). Still as the root user:

 sed -e '/#DEFAULT_ED/ a DEFAULT_EDITOR:vi'       \
     -i /etc/lynx/lynx.cfg

   Lynx handles the following values of the DEFAULT_EDITOR option specially
   by adding cursor-positioning arguments: âemacsâ, âjedâ, âjmacsâ, âjoeâ,
   âjoveâ, âjpicoâ, âjstarâ, ânanoâ, âpicoâ, ârjoeâ, âviâ (but not âvimâ: in
   order to position the cursor in Vim-8.1.1846, set this option to âviâ).

   By default, Lynx doesn't save cookies between sessions. Again as the root
   user, change this setting:

 sed -e '/#PERSIST/    a PERSISTENT_COOKIES:TRUE' \
     -i /etc/lynx/lynx.cfg

   Many other system-wide settings such as proxies can also be set in the
   /etc/lynx/lynx.cfg file.

Chapter 19. Mail/News Clients

   Mail Clients help you retrieve (Fetchmail), sort (Procmail), read and
   compose responses (Heirloom mailx, Mutt, Pine, Kmail, Balsa, Evolution,
   SeaMonkey) to email.

   News clients also help you retrieve, sort, read and compose responses, but
   these messages travel through USENET (a worldwide bulletin board system)
   using the Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP).

Fetchmail-6.3.26

  Introduction to Fetchmail

   The Fetchmail package contains a mail retrieval program. It retrieves mail
   from remote mail servers and forwards it to the local (client) machine's
   delivery system, so it can then be read by normal mail user agents.

   This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS-9.0
   platform.

   Now, as the root user:

 make install

  Command Explanations

   --with-ssl: This enables SSL support, so that you can handle connections
   to secure POP3 and IMAP servers.

   --enable-fallback=procmail: This tells Fetchmail to hand incoming mail to
   Procmail for delivery, if the port 25 mail server is not present or not
   responding.

      Optional (To Regenerate HTML Documentation)

   libxslt-1.1.33 and either Lynx-2.8.9rel.1, W3m, or ELinks

      Optional (To Generate PDF Manual)

   docbook-dsssl-1.79, OpenJade-1.3.2, and texlive-20190410 (or
   install-tl-unx with pdfjadetex installed)

   User Notes: http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/mutt

  Installation of Mutt

   Mutt requires a group named mail. You can add this group, if it does not
   exist, with this command:

 groupadd -g 34 mail

   If you did not install an MTA, you need to modify the ownership of
   /var/mail with this command:

 chgrp -v mail /var/mail

   Mutt will rebuild the html documentation if libxslt is present, then use
   that to update the text manual - even if none of the specified browsers
   are present. That will create an empty text file, so we will save the
   shipped file.

   Install Mutt by running the following commands:

 cp -v doc/manual.txt{,.shipped} &&
 ./configure --prefix=/usr                           \
             --sysconfdir=/etc                       \
             --with-docdir=/usr/share/doc/mutt-1.12.1 \
             --with-ssl                              \
             --enable-external-dotlock               \
             --enable-pop                            \
             --enable-imap                           \
             --enable-hcache                         \
             --enable-sidebar                        &&
 make

   To generate the PDF manual with texlive-20190410, run the following
   command:

 make -C doc manual.pdf

   This package does not come with a test suite.

   Now, as the root user:

 make install &&
 test -s doc/manual.txt ||
   install -v -m644 doc/manual.txt.shipped \
   /usr/share/doc/mutt-1.12.1/manual.txt

   If you generated the PDF manual, install it by issuing the following
   command as the root user:

 install -v -m644 doc/manual.pdf \
     /usr/share/doc/mutt-1.12.1

  Note

   If you used a DESTDIR method to only install to a temporary location as a
   regular user (as part of a package menagement process), you will need to
   run the following as the root user after completing the real install:

 chown root:mail /usr/bin/mutt_dotlock &&
 chmod -v 2755 /usr/bin/mutt_dotlock

   An info file is now installed, so you will also need to recreate the
   /usr/share/info/dir as described when Texinfo was installed in LFS.

  Command Explanations

   --enable-external-dotlock: In some circumstances the mutt-dotlock program
   is not created. This switch ensures it is always created.

   --enable-pop: This switch enables POP3 support.

   --enable-imap: This switch enables IMAP support.

   --enable-hcache: This switch enables header caching.

   --enable-sidebar: This switch enables support for the sidebar (a list of
   mailboxes). It is off by default, but can be turned on by :set
   sidebar_visible in mutt (and off again with ':unset'), or it can be
   enabled in ~/.muttrc.

   --with-ssl: This parameter adds SSL/TLS support from openssl in
   POP3/IMAP/SMTP.

   --enable-gpgme: This switch enables GPG support through the GPGME package.
   Use this switch if you want GPG support in Mutt.

   --enable-smtp: This switch enables SMTP relay support.

   --with-idn2: Use this parameter if both libidn and libidn2 have been
   installed, and you wish to use libidn2 here.

   --with-sasl: This parameter adds authentication support from Cyrus
   SASL-2.1.27 in POP3/IMAP/SMTP if they are enabled. Depending on the server
   configuration, this may not be needed for POP3 or IMAP. However, it is
   needed for SMTP authentication.

   test -s doc/manual.txt || install -v -m644 doc/manual.txt.shipped ...: if
   the text manual is now empty (libxslt is installed, but without any of the
   specified text browsers), install the saved copy after running 'make
   install' (which would itself empty manual.txt if the shipped file had
   already been copied back).

  Configuring Mutt

    Config Files

   /etc/Muttrc, ~/.muttrc, /etc/mime.types, ~/.mime.types

    Configuration Information

   No changes in these files are necessary to begin using Mutt. When you are
   ready to make changes, the man page for muttrc is a good starting place.

   In order to utilize GnuPG, use the following command:

 cat /usr/share/doc/mutt-1.12.1/samples/gpg.rc >> ~/.muttrc

  Installation of Apache HTTPD

   For security reasons, running the server as an unprivileged user and group
   is strongly encouraged. Create the following group and user using the
   following commands as root:

 groupadd -g 25 apache &&
 useradd -c "Apache Server" -d /srv/www -g apache \
         -s /bin/false -u 25 apache

   Build and install Apache HTTPD by running the following commands:

 patch -Np1 -i ../httpd-2.4.41-blfs_layout-1.patch             &&

 sed '/dir.*CFG_PREFIX/s@^@#@' -i support/apxs.in              &&

 ./configure --enable-authnz-fcgi                              \
             --enable-layout=BLFS                              \
             --enable-mods-shared="all cgi"                    \
             --enable-mpms-shared=all                          \
             --enable-suexec=shared                            \
             --with-apr=/usr/bin/apr-1-config                  \
             --with-apr-util=/usr/bin/apu-1-config             \
             --with-suexec-bin=/usr/lib/httpd/suexec           \
             --with-suexec-caller=apache                       \
             --with-suexec-docroot=/srv/www                    \
             --with-suexec-logfile=/var/log/httpd/suexec.log   \
             --with-suexec-uidmin=100                          \
             --with-suexec-userdir=public_html                 &&
 make

   This package does not come with a test suite.

   Now, as the root user:

  Note

   This package does not install properly using DESTDIR techniques as an
   unpriviledged user.

 make install  &&

 mv -v /usr/sbin/suexec /usr/lib/httpd/suexec &&
 chgrp apache           /usr/lib/httpd/suexec &&
 chmod 4754             /usr/lib/httpd/suexec &&

 chown -v -R apache:apache /srv/www

  Command Explanations

   sed '/dir.*CFG_PREFIX/s@^@#@'...: Forces the apxs utility to use absolute
   pathnames for modules, when instructed to do so.

   --enable-authnz-fcgi: Build FastCGI authorizer-based authentication and
   authorization (mod_authnz_fcgi.so fast CGI module).

   --enable-mods-shared="all cgi": The modules should be compiled and used as
   Dynamic Shared Objects (DSOs) so they can be included and excluded from
   the server using the run-time configuration directives.

   --enable-mpms-shared=all: This switch ensures that all MPM (Multi
   Processing Modules) are built as Dynamic Shared Objects (DSOs), so the
   user can choose which one to use at runtime.

   --enable-suexec: This switch enables building of the Apache suEXEC module
   which can be used to allow users to run CGI and SSI scripts under user IDs
   different from the user ID of the calling web server.

   --with-suexec-*: These switches control suEXEC module behavior, such as
   default document root, minimal UID that can be used to run the script
   under the suEXEC. Please note that with minimal UID 100, you can't run CGI
   or SSI scripts under suEXEC as the apache user.

   ... /usr/lib/httpd/suexec: These commands put suexec wrapper into proper
   location, since it is not meant to be run directly. They also adjust
   proper permissions of the binary, making it setgid apache.

   chown -R apache:apache /srv/www: By default, the installation process
   installs files (documentation, error messages, default icons, etc.) with
   the ownership of the user that extracted the files from the tar file. If
   you want to change the ownership to another user, you should do so at this
   point. The only requirement is that the document directories need to be
   accessible by the httpd process with (r-x) permissions and files need to
   be readable (r--) by the apache user.

  Configuring Apache

    Config Files

   /etc/httpd/httpd.conf and /etc/httpd/extra/*

    Configuration Information

   See file:///usr/share/httpd/manual/configuring.html for detailed
   instructions on customising your Apache HTTP server configuration file.

    Boot Script

   If you want the Apache server to start automatically when the system is
   booted, install the /etc/rc.d/init.d/httpd init script included in the
   blfs-bootscripts-20190609 package.

 make install-httpd

  Contents

   Installed Programs: ab, apachectl, apxs, checkgid, dbmmanage, fcgistarter,
   htcacheclean, htdbm, htdigest, htpasswd, httpd, httxt2dbm, logresolve,
   rotatelogs, and suexec
   Installed Libraries: Several libraries under /usr/lib/httpd/modules/
   Installed Directories: /etc/httpd, /srv/www, /usr/include/httpd,
   /usr/lib/httpd, /usr/share/httpd, /var/log/httpd, and /var/run/httpd

    Short Descriptions

   ab           is a tool for benchmarking your Apache HTTP server.           
   apachectl    is a front end to the Apache HTTP server which is designed to 
                help the administrator control the functioning of the Apache  
                httpd daemon.                                                 
   apxs         is a tool for building and installing extension modules for   
                the Apache HTTP server.                                       
   checkgid     is a program that checks whether it can setgid to the group   
                specified. This is to see if it is a valid group for Apache2  
                to use at runtime. If the user (should be run as superuser)   
                is in that group, or can setgid to it, it will return 0.      
   dbmmanage    is used to create and update the DBM format files used to     
                store usernames and passwords for basic authentication of     
                HTTP users.                                                   
   fcgistarter  is a tool to start a FastCGI program.                         
   htcacheclean is used to clean up the disk cache.                           
   htdbm        is used to manipulate the DBM password databases.             
   htdigest     is used to create and update the flat-files used to store     
                usernames, realms and passwords for digest authentication of  
                HTTP users.                                                   
   htpasswd     is used to create and update the flat-files used to store     
                usernames and passwords for basic authentication of HTTP      
                users.                                                        
   httpd        is the Apache HTTP server program.                            
   httxt2dbm    is used to generate DBM files from text, for use in           
                RewriteMap.                                                   
   logresolve   is a post-processing program to resolve IP-addresses in       
                Apache's access log files.                                    
   rotatelogs   is a simple program for use in conjunction with Apache's      
                piped log file feature.                                       
   suexec       allows users to run CGI and SSI applications as a different   
                user.

BIND-9.14.5

  Introduction to BIND

   The BIND package provides a DNS server and client utilities. If you are
   only interested in the utilities, refer to the BIND Utilities-9.14.5.

   This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS-9.0
   platform.

    Package Information

     * Download (FTP): ftp://ftp.isc.org/isc/bind9/9.14.5/bind-9.14.5.tar.gz

     * Estimated build time: 0.9 SBU (with parallelism=4; add 30+ minutes,
       processor independent, to run the complete test suite)

    BIND Dependencies

      Recommended

   libcap-2.27 with PAM

      Optional

   libidn2-2.2.0, libxml2-2.9.9, MIT Kerberos V5-1.17, and geoip

      Optional database backends

   Berkeley DB-5.3.28, MariaDB-10.4.7 or MySQL, OpenLDAP-2.4.48,
   PostgreSQL-11.5, and unixODBC-2.3.7

   User Notes: http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/bind

  Installation of BIND

   To ensure BIND will build dnssec-keymgr, install a python module as the
   root user:

 pip3 install ply

   Install BIND by running the following commands:

 ./configure --prefix=/usr           \
             --sysconfdir=/etc       \
             --localstatedir=/var    \
             --mandir=/usr/share/man \
             --with-libtool          \
             --disable-static        &&
 make

   Issue the following commands to run the complete suite of tests. First, as
   the root user, set up some test interfaces:

  Note

   If IPv6 is not enabled in the kernel, there will be several error
   messages: "RTNETLINK answers: Operation not permitted". These messages do
   not affect the tests.

 bin/tests/system/ifconfig.sh up

   The test suite may indicate some skipped tests depending on what
   configuration options are used. Some tests are marked âUNTESTED â if
   Net-DNS-1.20 is not installed. To run the tests, as an unprivileged user,
   execute:

 make -k check

   Again as root, clean up the test interfaces:

 bin/tests/system/ifconfig.sh down

   Finally, install the package as the root user:

 make install &&

 install -v -m755 -d /usr/share/doc/bind-9.14.5/arm &&
 install -v -m644    doc/arm/*.html \
                     /usr/share/doc/bind-9.14.5/arm

  Command Explanations

   --sysconfdir=/etc: This parameter forces BIND to look for configuration
   files in /etc instead of /usr/etc.

   --with-libtool: This parameter forces the building of dynamic libraries
   and links the installed binaries to these libraries.

   --with-libidn2: This parameter enables the IDNA2008 (Internationalized
   Domain Names in Applications) support.

   --enable-fetchlimit: Use this option if you want to be able to limit the
   rate of recursive client queries. This may be useful on servers which
   receive a large number of queries.

   --disable-linux-caps: BIND can also be built without capability support by
   using this option, at the cost of some loss of security.

   --with-dlz-{mysql,bdb,filesystem,ldap,odbc,stub}: Use one (or more) of
   those options to add Dynamically Loadable Zones support. For more
   information refer to bind-dlz.sourceforge.net.

   --disable-static: This switch prevents installation of static versions of
   the libraries.

   cd doc; install ...: These commands install additional package
   documentation. Omit any or all of these commands if desired.

  Configuring BIND

    Config files

   named.conf, root.hints, 127.0.0, rndc.conf and resolv.conf

    Configuration Information

   BIND will be configured to run in a chroot jail as an unprivileged user
   (named). This configuration is more secure in that a DNS compromise can
   only affect a few files in the named user's HOME directory.

   Create the unprivileged user and group named:

 groupadd -g 20 named &&
 useradd -c "BIND Owner" -g named -s /bin/false -u 20 named &&
 install -d -m770 -o named -g named /srv/named

   Set up some files, directories and devices needed by BIND:

 mkdir -p /srv/named &&
 cd       /srv/named &&
 mkdir -p dev etc/namedb/{slave,pz} usr/lib/engines var/run/named &&
 mknod /srv/named/dev/null c 1 3 &&
 mknod /srv/named/dev/urandom c 1 9 &&
 chmod 666 /srv/named/dev/{null,urandom} &&
 cp /etc/localtime etc &&
 touch /srv/named/managed-keys.bind

   The rndc.conf file contains information for controlling named operations
   with the rndc utility. Generate a key for use in the named.conf and
   rdnc.conf with the rndc-confgen command:

 rndc-confgen -r /dev/urandom -b 512 > /etc/rndc.conf &&
 sed '/conf/d;/^#/!d;s:^# ::' /etc/rndc.conf > /srv/named/etc/named.conf

   Complete the named.conf file from which named will read the location of
   zone files, root name servers and secure DNS keys:

 cat >> /srv/named/etc/named.conf << "EOF"
 options {
     directory "/etc/namedb";
     pid-file "/var/run/named.pid";
     statistics-file "/var/run/named.stats";

 };
 zone "." {
     type hint;
     file "root.hints";
 };
 zone "0.0.127.in-addr.arpa" {
     type master;
     file "pz/127.0.0";
 };

 // Bind 9 now logs by default through syslog (except debug).
 // These are the default logging rules.

 logging {
     category default { default_syslog; default_debug; };
     category unmatched { null; };

   channel default_syslog {
       syslog daemon;                      // send to syslog's daemon
                                           // facility
       severity info;                      // only send priority info
                                           // and higher
   };

   channel default_debug {
       file "named.run";                   // write to named.run in
                                           // the working directory
                                           // Note: stderr is used instead
                                           // of "named.run"
                                           // if the server is started
                                           // with the '-f' option.
       severity dynamic;                   // log at the server's
                                           // current debug level
   };

   channel default_stderr {
       stderr;                             // writes to stderr
       severity info;                      // only send priority info
                                           // and higher
   };

   channel null {
       null;                               // toss anything sent to
                                           // this channel
   };
 };
 EOF

   Create a zone file with the following contents:

 cat > /srv/named/etc/namedb/pz/127.0.0 << "EOF"
 $TTL 3D
 @      IN      SOA     ns.local.domain. hostmaster.local.domain. (
                         1       ; Serial
                         8H      ; Refresh
                         2H      ; Retry
                         4W      ; Expire
                         1D)     ; Minimum TTL
                 NS      ns.local.domain.
 1               PTR     localhost.

   Create the root.hints file with the following commands:

  Note

   Caution must be used to ensure there are no leading spaces in this file.

   The root.hints file is a list of root name servers. This file must be
   updated periodically with the dig utility. A current copy of root.hints
   can be obtained from ftp://rs.internic.net/domain/named.root. For details,
   consult the "BIND 9 Administrator Reference Manual", included in every
   source archive of BIND 9 distributed by ISC, in HTML and PDF formats, also
   available at BIND 9 Administrator Reference Manual.

   Create or modify resolv.conf to use the new name server with the following
   commands:

  Note

   Replace <yourdomain.com> with your own valid domain name.

 cp /etc/resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf.bak &&
 cat > /etc/resolv.conf << "EOF"
 search <yourdomain.com>
 nameserver 127.0.0.1
 EOF

   Set permissions on the chroot jail with the following command:

 chown -R named:named /srv/named

    Boot Script

   To start the DNS server at boot, install the /etc/rc.d/init.d/bind init
   script included in the blfs-bootscripts-20190609 package.

 make install-bind

   Now start BIND with the following command:

 /etc/rc.d/init.d/bind start

    Testing BIND

   Test out the new BIND 9 installation. First query the local host address
   with dig:

 dig -x 127.0.0.1

   Now try an external name lookup, taking note of the speed difference in
   repeated lookups due to the caching. Run the dig command twice on the same
   address:

 dig www.linuxfromscratch.org &&
 dig www.linuxfromscratch.org

   You can see almost instantaneous results with the named caching lookups.
   Consult the BIND Administrator Reference Manual located at
   doc/arm/Bv9ARM.html in the package source tree, for further configuration
   options.

     * Download size: 19 MB

     * Estimated disk space required: 65 MB

     * Estimated build time: 0.3 SBU

    Additional Downloads

     * Required patch:
       http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/patches/blfs/9.0/proftpd-1.3.6-consolidated_fixes-1.patch

    ProFTPD Dependencies

      Optional

   libcap-2.27 with PAM, libssh2-1.9.0, Linux-PAM-1.3.1, MariaDB-10.4.7 or
   MySQL, PCRE-8.43, PostgreSQL-11.5, and Net::SSH2

   User Notes: http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/proftpd

  Installation of ProFTPD

   For security reasons, you should install ProFTPD using an unprivileged
   user and group. As the root user:

 groupadd -g 46 proftpd                             &&
 useradd -c proftpd -d /srv/ftp -g proftpd \
         -s /usr/bin/proftpdshell -u 46 proftpd     &&

 install -v -d -m775 -o proftpd -g proftpd /srv/ftp &&
 ln -v -s /bin/false /usr/bin/proftpdshell          &&
 echo /usr/bin/proftpdshell >> /etc/shells

   First, apply a patch containing various security fixes from the upstream
   developers:

 patch -Np1 -i ../proftpd-1.3.6-consolidated_fixes-1.patch

   Install ProFTPD as an unprivileged user by running the following commands:

 ./configure --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc --localstatedir=/var/run &&
 make

   This packages does not come with a usable test suite.

   Now, as the root user:

 make install                                   &&
 install -d -m755 /usr/share/doc/proftpd-1.3.6 &&
 cp -Rv doc/*     /usr/share/doc/proftpd-1.3.6

  Command Explanations

   install -v -d -m775 -o proftpd -g proftpd /srv/ftp: Create the home
   directory for ProFTPD.

   ln -v -s /bin/false /usr/bin/proftpdshell: Set the default shell as a link
   to an invalid shell.

   echo /usr/bin/proftpdshell >> /etc/shells: Fake a valid shell for
   compatibility purposes.

  Note

   The above two commands can be omitted if the following directive is placed
   in the configuration file:

 RequireValidShell off

   By default, proftpd will require that users logging in have valid shells.
   The RequireValidShell directive turns off this requirement. This is only
   recommended if you are setting up your FTP server exclusively for
   anonymous downloads.

  Note

   Support for most of the dependency packages requires using options passed
   to the configure script. View the output from ./configure --help for
   complete information about enabling dependency packages.

vsftpd-3.0.3

  Introduction to vsftpd

   The vsftpd package contains a very secure and very small FTP daemon. This

     * Estimated build time: less than 0.1 SBU

    vsftpd Dependencies

      Required

   libnsl-1.2.0

      Optional

   libcap-2.27 with PAM, and Linux-PAM-1.3.1

   User Notes: http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/vsftpd

  Installation of vsftpd

   For security reasons, running vsftpd as an unprivileged user and group is
   encouraged. Also, a user should be created to map anonymous users. As the
   root user, create the needed directories, users, and groups with the
   following commands:

 install -v -d -m 0755 /usr/share/vsftpd/empty &&
 install -v -d -m 0755 /home/ftp               &&
 groupadd -g 47 vsftpd                         &&
 groupadd -g 45 ftp                            &&

 useradd -c "vsftpd User"  -d /dev/null -g vsftpd -s /bin/false -u 47 vsftpd &&
 useradd -c anonymous_user -d /home/ftp -g ftp    -s /bin/false -u 45 ftp

   Build vsftpd as an unprivileged user using the following command:

 make

   This package does not come with a test suite.

   Once again, become the root user and install vsftpd with the following
   commands:

 install -v -m 755 vsftpd        /usr/sbin/vsftpd    &&
 install -v -m 644 vsftpd.8      /usr/share/man/man8 &&
 install -v -m 644 vsftpd.conf.5 /usr/share/man/man5 &&
 install -v -m 644 vsftpd.conf   /etc

  Command Explanations

   install -v -d ...: This creates the directory that anonymous users will
   use (/home/ftp) and the directory the daemon will chroot into
   (/usr/share/vsftpd/empty).

  Note

   /home/ftp should not be owned by the user vsftpd, or the user ftp.

   echo "#define VSF_BUILD_TCPWRAPPERS" >>builddefs.h: Use this prior to make
   to add support for tcpwrappers.

   echo "#define VSF_BUILD_SSL" >>builddefs.h: Use this prior to make to add
   support for SSL.

   install -v -m ...: The Makefile uses non-standard installation paths.
   These commands install the files in /usr and /etc.

  Configuring vsftpd

    Config Files

   /etc/vsftpd.conf

    Configuration Information

   vsftpd comes with a basic anonymous-only configuration file that was
   copied to /etc above. While still as root, this file should be modified
   because it is now recommended to run vsftpd in standalone mode. Also, you
   should specify the privilege separation user created above. Finally, you
   should specify the chroot directory. man vsftpd.conf will give you all the
   details.

 cat >> /etc/vsftpd.conf << "EOF"
 background=YES
 listen=YES
 nopriv_user=vsftpd
 secure_chroot_dir=/usr/share/vsftpd/empty
 EOF

   The vsftpd daemon uses seccomp to improve security by default. But it's
   known to cause vsftpd unable to handle ftp LIST command with recent kernel
   versions. Append a line to /etc/vsftpd.conf (as the root user) to disable
   seccomp and workaround this issue:

 cat >> /etc/vsftpd.conf << "EOF"
 seccomp_sandbox=NO
 EOF

   To enable local logins, append the following to the /etc/vsftpd.conf file
   (as the root user):

 cat >> /etc/vsftpd.conf << "EOF"
 local_enable=YES
 EOF

   In addition, if using Linux-PAM and vsftpd with local user logins, you
   will need a Linux-PAM configuration file. As the root user, create the
   /etc/pam.d/vsftpd file, and add the needed configuration changes for
   Linux-PAM session support using the following commands:

 cat > /etc/pam.d/vsftpd << "EOF" &&
 # Begin /etc/pam.d/vsftpd
 auth       required     /lib/security/pam_listfile.so item=user sense=deny \
                                                       file=/etc/ftpusers \
                                                       onerr=succeed
 auth       required     pam_shells.so
 auth       include      system-auth
 account    include      system-account
 session    include      system-session
 EOF

 cat >> /etc/vsftpd.conf << "EOF"
 session_support=YES
 pam_service_name=vsftpd
 EOF

    Boot Script

   Install the /etc/rc.d/init.d/vsftpd init script included in the
   blfs-bootscripts-20190609 package.

 make install-vsftpd

  Contents

   Installed Program: vsftpd
   Installed Libraries: None
   Installed Directories: /usr/share/vsftpd, /home/ftp

    Short Descriptions

   User Notes: http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/dovecot

  Installation of Dovecot

   There should be dedicated users and groups for unprivileged Dovecot
   processes and for processing users' logins. Issue the following commands
   as the root user:

 groupadd -g 42 dovecot &&
 useradd -c "Dovecot unprivileged user" -d /dev/null -u 42 \
         -g dovecot -s /bin/false dovecot &&
 groupadd -g 43 dovenull &&
 useradd -c "Dovecot login user" -d /dev/null -u 43 \
         -g dovenull -s /bin/false dovenull

   First, fix an issue causing a segfault in the test suite by applying a
   sed:

 sed -e "s;#include <unistd.h>;&\n#include <crypt.h>;" \
     -i src/auth/mycrypt.c

   Install Dovecot by running the following commands:

 CFLAGS+=" -I/usr/include/tirpc" \
 LDFLAGS+=" -ltirpc" \
 ./configure --prefix=/usr                          \
             --sysconfdir=/etc                      \
             --localstatedir=/var                   \
             --docdir=/usr/share/doc/dovecot-2.3.7.2 \
             --disable-static &&
 make

   To test the results, issue make -k check.

   Now, as the root user:

 make install

  Command Explanations

   CFLAGS+=...LDFLAGS+=...: build with libtirpc instead of the recently
   removed RPC code provided by GlibC.

   --disable-static: This switch prevents installation of static versions of
   the libraries.

   --with-ldap: This switch enables OpenLDAP authentication support.

   --with-pgsql: This switch enables PostgreSQL authentication support.

   --with-mysql: This switch enables MySQL authentication support.

   --with-sqlite: This switch enables SQLite authentication support.

   --with-lucene: This switch enables CLucene full text search support.

  Configuring Dovecot

    Config Files

   /etc/dovecot/dovecot.conf, /etc/dovecot/conf.d/*, and
   /etc/dovecot/local.conf

    Configuration Information

   Copy an example configuration, which you can use as a starting point:

 cp -rv /usr/share/doc/dovecot-2.3.7.2/example-config/* /etc/dovecot

   The following configuration is a simple proof of concept with IMAP service
   using local users for authentication and mailbox location. Reading files
   from the conf.d directory is commented out since the included example
   configuration requires OpenSSL and Linux PAM.

 sed -i '/^\!include / s/^/#/' /etc/dovecot/dovecot.conf &&
 chmod -v 1777 /var/mail &&
 cat > /etc/dovecot/local.conf << "EOF"
 protocols = imap
 ssl = no
 # The next line is only needed if you have no IPv6 network interfaces
 listen = *
 mail_location = mbox:~/Mail:INBOX=/var/mail/%u
 userdb {
   driver = passwd
 }
 passdb {
   driver = shadow
 }
 EOF

   You will definitely want to read the official documentation at
   http://wiki2.dovecot.org/ if you plan to use Dovecot in production
   environment.

    Boot Script

   If you want the Dovecot server to start automatically when the system is
   booted, install the /etc/rc.d/init.d/dovecot init script included in the
   blfs-bootscripts-20190609 package.

 make install-dovecot

  Contents

   Installed Programs: doveadm, doveconf, dovecot, and dsync (symbolic link)
   Installed Libraries: various internal plugins in /usr/lib/dovecot
   Installed Directories: /etc/dovecot,
   /usr/{include,lib,libexec,share}/dovecot and
   /usr/share/doc/dovecot-2.3.7.2

    Short Descriptions

   doveadm  is the Dovecot administration tool.           
   doveconf is Dovecot's configuration dumping utility.   
   dovecot  is the IMAP and POP server.                   
   dsync    is Dovecot's mailbox synchronization utility.

   PostgreSQL-11.5, SQLite-3.29.0, X Window System, Heimdal GSSAPI, and
   OpenDMARC

   User Notes: http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/exim

  Installation of Exim

   Before building Exim, as the root user you should create the group and
   user exim which will run the exim daemon:

 groupadd -g 31 exim &&
 useradd -d /dev/null -c "Exim Daemon" -g exim -s /bin/false -u 31 exim

   Install Exim with the following commands:

 sed -e 's,^BIN_DIR.*$,BIN_DIRECTORY=/usr/sbin,'    \
     -e 's,^CONF.*$,CONFIGURE_FILE=/etc/exim.conf,' \
     -e 's,^EXIM_USER.*$,EXIM_USER=exim,'           \
     -e '/SUPPORT_TLS/s,^#,,'                       \
     -e '/USE_OPENSSL/s,^#,,'                       \
     -e '515 d'                                     \
     -e 's,^EXIM_MONITOR,#EXIM_MONITOR,' src/EDITME > Local/Makefile &&

 printf "USE_GDBM = yes\nDBMLIB = -lgdbm\n" >> Local/Makefile &&
 make

   This package does not come with a test suite.

   Now, as the root user:

 make install                                    &&
 install -v -m644 doc/exim.8 /usr/share/man/man8 &&

 install -v -d -m755    /usr/share/doc/exim-4.92.1 &&
 install -v -m644 doc/* /usr/share/doc/exim-4.92.1 &&

 ln -sfv exim /usr/sbin/sendmail                 &&
 install -v -d -m750 -o exim -g exim /var/spool/exim

  Command Explanations

   sed -e ... > Local/Makefile: Most of Exim's configuration options are
   defined in Local/Makefile, which is created from the src/EDITME file. This
   command specifies the minimum set of options. Descriptions for the options
   are listed below.

   printf ... > Local/Makefile: Setting those variables allows to use GDBM
   instead of the default Berkeley DB. Remove this command if you have
   installed Berkeley DB-5.3.28.

   BIN_DIRECTORY=/usr/sbin: This installs all of Exim's binaries and scripts
   in /usr/sbin.

   CONFIGURE_FILE=/etc/exim.conf: This installs Exim's main configuration
   file in /etc.

   EXIM_USER=exim: This tells Exim that after the daemon no longer needs root
   privileges, the process hands off the daemon to the exim user.

   SUPPORT_TLS=yes: This allows to support STARTTLS connections. If you use
   this option, you need to select whether OpenSSL or GnuTLS is used (see
   src/EDITME).

   USE_OPENSSL_PC=openssl: This tells the build system to use OpenSSL, and to
   find the needed libraries with pkg-config.

   #EXIM_MONITOR: This defers building the Exim monitor program, as it
   requires X Window System support, by commenting out the EXIM_MONITOR line
   in the Makefile. If you wish to build the monitor program, omit this sed
   command and issue the following command before building the package
   (modify Local/eximon.conf, if necessary): cp exim_monitor/EDITME
   Local/eximon.conf.

   ln -sfv exim /usr/sbin/sendmail: Creates a link to sendmail for
   applications which need it. Exim will accept most Sendmail command-line
   options.

   install -v -m750 -o exim -g exim /var/spool/exim: Since /var/spool is
   owned by root and this version of exim drops root privileges early, to run
   as user exim, it cannot create the /var/spool/exim directory. As a work
   around, it is created manually.

  Adding Additional Functionality

   To utilize some or all of the dependency packages, you'll need to modify
   Local/Makefile to include the appropriate directives and parameters to
   link additional libraries before you build Exim. Local/Makefile is heavily
   commented with instructions on how to do this. Listed below is additional
   information to help you link these dependency packages or add additional
   functionality.

   If you wish to build and install the .info documentation, refer to
   http://exim.org/exim-html-4.92.1/doc/html/spec_html/ch04.html#SECTinsinfdoc.

   If you wish to build in Exim's interfaces for calling virus and spam
   scanning software directly from access control lists, uncomment the
   WITH_CONTENT_SCAN=yes parameter and review the information found at
   http://exim.org/exim-html-4.92.1/doc/html/spec_html/ch45.html.

   To use a backend database other than Berkeley DB, see the instructions at
   http://exim.org/exim-html-4.92.1/doc/html/spec_html/ch04.html#SECTdb.

   For SSL functionality, see the instructions at

   For information about linking database engine libraries used for Exim name
   lookups, see the instructions at
   http://exim.org/exim-html-4.92.1/doc/html/spec_html/ch09.html.

   If you wish to add Readline support to Exim when invoked in âtest
   expansionâ (-be) mode, see the information in the -be section of
   http://exim.org/exim-html-4.92.1/doc/html/spec_html/ch05.html#id2525974.

   You may wish to modify the default configuration and send log files to
   syslog instead of the default /var/spool/exim/log directory. See the
   information at
   http://exim.org/exim-html-4.92.1/doc/html/spec_html/ch52.html.

   A wealth of information can be also found at the Exim Wiki.

  Configuring Exim

    Config Files

   /etc/exim.conf and /etc/aliases

    Configuration Information

   Review the file /etc/exim.conf, and modify any settings to suit your
   needs. Note that the default configuration assumes that the /var/mail
   directory is world writable, but has the sticky bit set. If you want to
   use the default configuration, issue as the root user:

 chmod -v a+wt /var/mail

   A default (nothing but comments) /etc/aliases file is installed during the
   package installation if this file did not exist on your system. Create the
   necessary aliases and start the Exim daemon using the following commands:

 cat >> /etc/aliases << "EOF"
 postmaster: root
 MAILER-DAEMON: root
 EOF
 exim -v -bi &&
 /usr/sbin/exim -bd -q15m

  Note

   To protect an existing /etc/aliases file, the command above appends these
   aliases to it. This file should be checked and duplicate aliases removed,
   if present.

   The /usr/sbin/exim -bd -q15m command starts the Exim daemon with a 15
   minute interval in processing the mail queue. Adjust this parameter to
   suit your desires.

    Boot Script

   To automatically start exim at boot, install the /etc/rc.d/init.d/exim
   init script included in the blfs-bootscripts-20190609 package.

 make install-exim

   The bootscript also starts the Exim daemon and dispatches a queue runner
   process every 15 minutes. Modify the -q<time interval> parameter in
   /etc/rc.d/init.d/exim, if necessary for your installation.

Postfix-3.4.6

  Introduction to Postfix

   The Postfix package contains a Mail Transport Agent (MTA). This is useful
   for sending email to other users of your host machine. It can also be
   configured to be a central mail server for your domain, a mail relay agent
   or simply a mail delivery agent to your local Internet Service Provider.

   This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS-9.0
   platform.

   known need for them.

   User Notes: http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/postfix

  Installation of Postfix

    Adding Users and Groups

   Before you compile the program, you need to create users and groups that
   will be expected to be in place during the installation. Add the users and
   groups with the following commands issued by the root user:

 groupadd -g 32 postfix &&
 groupadd -g 33 postdrop &&
 useradd -c "Postfix Daemon User" -d /var/spool/postfix -g postfix \
         -s /bin/false -u 32 postfix &&
 chown -v postfix:postfix /var/mail

    Configuring the Build

   The README files are formatted to be read with a pager like Less or More.
   If you want to use a text editor, make them legible with the following
   sed:

 sed -i 's/.\x08//g' README_FILES/*

   Apply a patch to allow Postfix to compile on Glibc-2.30 where some macros
   were dropped:

 patch -Np1 -i ../postfix-3.4.6-glibc230_fix-1.patch

   The Postfix source tree does not contain a configure script, rather the
   makefile in the top-level directory contains a makefiles target that
   regenerates all the other makefiles in the build tree. If you wish to use
   additional software such as a database back-end for virtual users, or
   TLS/SSL authentication, you will need to regenerate the makefiles using
   one or more of the appropriate CCARGS and AUXLIBS settings listed below.

   For more details read the readme files.

      Cyrus-SASL

   To use Cyrus-SASL with Postfix, use the following arguments:

 CCARGS='-DUSE_SASL_AUTH -DUSE_CYRUS_SASL -I/usr/include/sasl'
 AUXLIBS='-lsasl2'

      OpenLDAP

   To use OpenLDAP with Postfix, use the following arguments:

 CCARGS='-DHAS_LDAP'
 AUXLIBS='-lldap -llber'

      Sqlite

   To use Sqlite with Postfix, use the following arguments:

 CCARGS='-DHAS_SQLITE'
 AUXLIBS='-lsqlite3 -lpthread'

      MySQL

   To use MySQL with Postfix, use the following arguments:

 CCARGS='-DHAS_MYSQL -I/usr/include/mysql'
 AUXLIBS='-lmysqlclient -lz -lm'

      PostgreSQL

   To use PostgreSQL with Postfix, use the following arguments:

 CCARGS='-DHAS_PGSQL -I/usr/include/postgresql'
 AUXLIBS='-lpq -lz -lm'

      CDB/TinyCDB

   To use CDB or TinyCDB with Postfix, use the following arguments:

 CCARGS='-DHAS_CDB'
 AUXLIBS='</path/to/CDB>/libcdb.a'

      StartTLS Authentication

   To use OpenSSL with Postfix, use the following arguments:

 CCARGS='-DUSE_TLS -I/usr/include/openssl/'
 AUXLIBS='-lssl -lcrypto'

    Installing Postfix

   Now fix a file to work with Linux-5.x.

 sed -i -e 's/\$RELEASE_MAJOR/3/' \
        -e '/Linux..3/s/34/345/' makedefs

   If you have Cyrus SASL and OpenSSL installed, install Postfix by running
   the following commands:

 make CCARGS="-DUSE_TLS -I/usr/include/openssl/                     \
              -DUSE_SASL_AUTH -DUSE_CYRUS_SASL -I/usr/include/sasl" \
      AUXLIBS="-lssl -lcrypto -lsasl2"                              \
      makefiles &&
 make

   This package does not come with a useful test suite.

   Now, as the root user:

 sh postfix-install -non-interactive \
    daemon_directory=/usr/lib/postfix \
    manpage_directory=/usr/share/man \
    html_directory=/usr/share/doc/postfix-3.4.6/html \
    readme_directory=/usr/share/doc/postfix-3.4.6/readme

  Command Explanations

   make makefiles: This command rebuilds the makefiles throughout the source
   tree to use the options contained in the CCARGS and AUXLIBS variables.

   sh postfix-install -non-interactive: This keeps the install script from
   asking any questions, thereby accepting default destination directories in
   all but the few cases. If the html_directory and readme_directory options
   are not set then the documentation will not be installed.

   CCARGS="-DNO_EAI ...": this will turn off SMTPUTF8 support, for example if
   the rest of your email address infrastructure cannot handle UTF-8 email
   addresses and message header values.

  Configuring Postfix

    Config Files

   /etc/aliases, /etc/postfix/main.cf, and /etc/postfix/master.cf

    Configuration Information

   Create (or append to an existing) /etc/aliases with the following command.
   Change <LOGIN> for your non-root login identity so mail addressed to root
   can be forwarded to you. As the root user:

 cat >> /etc/aliases << "EOF"
 # Begin /etc/aliases

 MAILER-DAEMON:    postmaster
 postmaster:       root

 root:             <LOGIN>
 # End /etc/aliases
 EOF

   To protect an existing /etc/aliases file, the above command appends these
   aliases to it if it exists. This file should be checked and duplicate
   aliases removed, if present.

  Note

   The /etc/postfix/main.cf and /etc/postfix/master.cf files must be
   personalized for your system. The main.cf file needs your fully qualified
   hostname. You will find that main.cf is self documenting, so load it into
   your editor to make the changes you need for your situation.

  Note

   Postfix can also be set up to run in a chroot jail. See the file in the
   source examples/chroot-setup/LINUX2 for details.

   If you have an existing configuration, you can run the postfix utility to
   add any necessary definitions to your existing files. As the root user:

 /usr/sbin/postfix upgrade-configuration

   Before starting Postfix, you should check that your configuration and file
   permissions will work properly. Run the following commands as the root
   user to check and start your Postfix server:

 /usr/sbin/postfix check &&
 /usr/sbin/postfix start

    Boot Script

   To automate the running of Postfix at startup, install the
   /etc/rc.d/init.d/postfix init script included in the
   blfs-bootscripts-20190609 package.

 make install-postfix

   User Notes: http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/sendmail

  Installation of sendmail

   Before building sendmail, create the required user, group and directory
   with the following commands issued as the root user:

 groupadd -g 26 smmsp                               &&
 useradd -c "Sendmail Daemon" -g smmsp -d /dev/null \
         -s /bin/false -u 26 smmsp                  &&
 chmod -v 1777 /var/mail                            &&
 install -v -m700 -d /var/spool/mqueue

  Note

   See the source tree sendmail/README file for information on linking
   optional packages into the build. Use the example below, which adds
   support for SASL, StartTLS (OpenSSL) and OpenLDAP, as a starting point. Of
   course, modify it to suit your particular needs.

 cat >> devtools/Site/site.config.m4 << "EOF"
 APPENDDEF(`confENVDEF',`-DSTARTTLS -DSASL -DLDAPMAP')
 APPENDDEF(`confLIBS', `-lssl -lcrypto -lsasl2 -lldap -llber -ldb')
 APPENDDEF(`confINCDIRS', `-I/usr/include/sasl')
 EOF

   Install sendmail with the following commands:

 patch -Np1 -i ../sendmail.8.15.2-openssl-1.patch &&

 cat >> devtools/Site/site.config.m4 << "EOF"
 define(`confMANGRP',`root')
 define(`confMANOWN',`root')
 define(`confSBINGRP',`root')

 cd ../cf/cf                     &&
 cp generic-linux.mc sendmail.mc &&
 sh Build sendmail.cf

   This package does not come with a test suite.

   Now, as the root user:

   Install the sendmail Installation and Operations Guide with the following
   commands:

  Note

   Remove op.pdf from the make and install commands below if you don't have
   Ghostscript installed.

 cd doc/op                                       &&
 sed -i 's/groff/GROFF_NO_SGR=1 groff/' Makefile &&
 make op.txt op.pdf

   Now, as the root user:

 install -v -d -m755 /usr/share/doc/sendmail-8.15.2 &&
 install -v -m644 op.ps op.txt op.pdf /usr/share/doc/sendmail-8.15.2 &&
 cd ../..

  Command Explanations

   cat > devtools/Site/site.config.m4 << "EOF": This creates a configuration
   file changing some of the default settings.

   sed ... devtools/OS/Linux: The site.config.m4 does not honor a change to
   the man directory, so fix it in the OS definitions.

   sed ... include/sm/bdb.h: This allows sendmail to build properly with
   Berkeley DB-5.3.28 versions 5 and above.

   sh Build; sh Build sendmail.cf; sh Build install-cf; sh Build install:
   sendmail uses an m4 based build script to create the various Makefiles.
   These commands build and install the package.

   for manpage in...;do...;done; install ...: The man pages are installed
   already formatted and man displays them somewhat garbled. These commands
   replace the formatted pages with pages man can display properly.

  Configuring sendmail

    Config Files

   /etc/mail/*

    Configuration Information

  Note

   Ensure you have a fully qualified domain name defined in /etc/hosts for
   your system before proceeding.

   Create the /etc/mail/local-host-names and /etc/mail/aliases files using
   the following commands as the root user:

 echo $(hostname) > /etc/mail/local-host-names
 cat > /etc/mail/aliases << "EOF"
 postmaster: root
 MAILER-DAEMON: root

 EOF
 newaliases

   sendmail's primary configuration file, /etc/mail/sendmail.cf, is complex
   and not meant to be directly edited. The recommended method for changing
   it is to modify /etc/mail/sendmail.mc and various m4 files, then run the
   m4 macro processor from within /etc/mail as follows:

 cd /etc/mail &&
 m4 m4/cf.m4 sendmail.mc > sendmail.cf

   A full explanation of the files to modify, and the available parameters
   can be found in /etc/mail/README.

    Boot Script

   To automate the running of sendmail at startup, install the
   /etc/rc.d/init.d/sendmail init script included in the
   blfs-bootscripts-20190609 package.

 make install-sendmail

  Note

   The -qNm option to sendmail, where N is number of minutes, controls how
   often sendmail will process the mail queue. A default of 5 minutes is used
   in the init script. Individual workstation users may want to set this as
   low as 1 minute, large installations handling more mail may want to set it
   higher.

    Berkeley DB Dependencies

      Optional

   Tcl-8.6.9 and Sharutils-4.15.2 (for the uudecode command)

   User Notes: http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/db

  Installation of Berkeley DB

   First apply a fix so that this will compile with current versions of g++:

 sed -i 's/\(__atomic_compare_exchange\)/\1_db/' src/dbinc/atomic.h

   Install Berkeley DB by running the following commands:

 cd build_unix                        &&
 ../dist/configure --prefix=/usr      \
                   --enable-compat185 \
                   --enable-dbm       \
                   --disable-static   \
                   --enable-cxx       &&
 make

   Now, as the root user:

 make docdir=/usr/share/doc/db-5.3.28 install &&

 chown -v -R root:root                        \
       /usr/bin/db_*                          \
       /usr/include/db{,_185,_cxx}.h          \
       /usr/lib/libdb*.{so,la}                \
       /usr/share/doc/db-5.3.28

  Command Explanations

   cd build_unix && ../dist/configure --prefix=/usr...: This replaces the
   normal ./configure command, as Berkeley DB comes with various build
   directories for different platforms.

   --enable-compat185: This switch enables building the DB-1.85 compatibility
   API.

   --enable-cxx: This switch enables building C++ API libraries.

   --enable-dbm: Enables legacy interface support needed by some older
   packages.

   make docdir=/usr/share/doc/db-5.3.28 install: This installs the
   documentation in the standard location instead of /usr/docs.

   chown -v -R root:root ...:This command changes the ownership of various
   installed files from the uid:gid of the builder to root:root.

   --enable-tcl --with-tcl=/usr/lib: Enables Tcl support in DB and creates
   the libdb_tcl libraries.

   --enable-java: Enables Java support in DB and creates the libdb_java
   libraries. Support is currently broken with Java-10.x.

   Installed Libraries: libdb.so, libdb_cxx.so, and libdb_tcl.so
   Installed Directory: /usr/share/doc/db-5.3.28

    Short Descriptions

   db_archive    prints the pathnames of log files that are no longer in use. 
   db_checkpoint is a daemon process used to monitor and checkpoint database  
                 logs.                                                        
   db_deadlock   is used to abort lock requests when deadlocks are detected.  
   db_dump       converts database files to a flat file format readable by    
                 db_load.                                                     
   db_hotbackup  creates "hot backup" or "hot failover" snapshots of Berkeley 
                 DB databases.                                                
   db_load       is used to create database files from flat files created     
                 with db_dump.

lmdb-0.9.24

  Introduction to lmdb

   The lmdb package is a fast, compact, key-value embedded data store. It
   uses memory-mapped files, so it has the read performance of a pure
   in-memory database while still offering the persistence of standard
   disk-based databases, and is only limited to the size of the virtual
   address space

   This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS-9.0
   platform.

   Now, as the root user:

 make prefix=/usr install

  Command Explanations

   sed ... prefix ... Makefile: The Makefile creates the man pages directory
   during install if it is not present. This fixes the directory location.

   sed ... liblmdb.a ... Makefile: The package executables use a static
   library so it must be created. This command suppresses installation of the
   static library.

  Installation of MariaDB

  Warning

   MariaDB and MySQL cannot be installed on the same system without extensive
   changes to the build configuration of one of the two applications.

   For security reasons, running the server as an unprivileged user and group
   is strongly encouraged. Issue the following (as root) to create the user
   and group:

 groupadd -g 40 mysql &&
 useradd -c "MySQL Server" -d /srv/mysql -g mysql -s /bin/false -u 40 mysql

   Install MariaDB by running the following commands:

 sed -i "s@data/test@\${INSTALL_MYSQLTESTDIR}@g" sql/CMakeLists.txt &&

 mkdir build &&
 cd    build &&

 cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release                      \

   To test the results, issue: make test. One test, test-connect, is known to
   fail.

  Note

   A more extensive set of tests can be run with the following:

 pushd mysql-test
 ./mtr --parallel <N> --mem --force
 popd

   Where N is the number of tests to run in parallel. A little over 3700
   tests are run in about 14 SBU with N=4. Three tests are known to fail due
   to character set issues.

   Now, as the root user:

 make install

  Command Explanations

   sed -i ... sql/CMakeLists.txt: Set correct installation directory for some
   components.

   -DWITH_EMBEDDED_SERVER=ON: This switch enables compiling the embedded
   server library needed by certain applications, such as Amarok..

   -DWITH_EXTRA_CHARSETS=complex: This switch enables support for the complex
   character sets.

   -DSKIP_TESTS=ON: This switch disables tests for MariaDB Connector/C which
   are not supported without additional setup.

   -DWITHOUT_SERVER=ON: Use this switch if you don't want the server and
   would like to build the client only.

  Note

   There are numerous options available to cmake. Check the output of the
   cmake . -LH for additional customization options.

  Configuring MySQL

    Config Files

   /etc/mysql/my.cnf and ~/.my.cnf

    Configuration Information

   Create basic /etc/mysql/my.cnf using the following command as the root
   user:

 install -v -dm 755 /etc/mysql &&
 cat > /etc/mysql/my.cnf << "EOF"
 # Begin /etc/mysql/my.cnf

 # The following options will be passed to all MySQL clients
 [client]
 #password       = your_password
 port            = 3306
 socket          = /run/mysqld/mysqld.sock

 # The MySQL server
 [mysqld]
 port            = 3306

 key_buffer_size = 16M
 max_allowed_packet = 1M
 sort_buffer_size = 512K
 net_buffer_length = 16K
 myisam_sort_buffer_size = 8M

 # Don't listen on a TCP/IP port at all.
 skip-networking

 # required unique id between 1 and 2^32 - 1
 server-id       = 1

 # Uncomment the following if you are using BDB tables
 #bdb_cache_size = 4M
 #bdb_max_lock = 10000

 # InnoDB tables are now used by default
 innodb_data_home_dir = /srv/mysql
 innodb_log_group_home_dir = /srv/mysql
 # All the innodb_xxx values below are the default ones:
 innodb_data_file_path = ibdata1:12M:autoextend
 # You can set .._buffer_pool_size up to 50 - 80 %
 # of RAM but beware of setting memory usage too high
 innodb_buffer_pool_size = 128M
 innodb_log_file_size = 48M
 innodb_log_buffer_size = 16M
 innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit = 1
 innodb_lock_wait_timeout = 50

 [mysqldump]
 quick
 max_allowed_packet = 16M

 [mysql]
 no-auto-rehash
 # Remove the next comment character if you are not familiar with SQL
 #safe-updates

 [isamchk]
 key_buffer = 20M
 sort_buffer_size = 20M

 write_buffer = 2M

 [myisamchk]

 sort_buffer_size = 20M
 read_buffer = 2M
 write_buffer = 2M

 [mysqlhotcopy]
 interactive-timeout

 # End /etc/mysql/my.cnf
 EOF

   You can now install a database and change the ownership to the
   unprivileged user and group (perform as the root user):

 mysql_install_db --basedir=/usr --datadir=/srv/mysql --user=mysql &&
 chown -R mysql:mysql /srv/mysql

   Further configuration requires that the MariaDB server is running. Start
   the server using the following commands as the root user:

 install -v -m755 -o mysql -g mysql -d /run/mysqld &&
 mysqld_safe --user=mysql 2>&1 >/dev/null &

   A default installation does not set up a password for the administrator,
   so use the following command as the root user to set one.

 mysqladmin -u root password

   Configuration of the server is now finished. Shut the server down using
   the following command as the root user:

 mysqladmin -p shutdown

    Boot Script

   Install the /etc/rc.d/init.d/mysql init script included in the
   blfs-bootscripts-20190609 package as the root user to start the MariaDB
   server during system boot-up.

 make install-mysql

   User Notes: http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/postgresql

  Installation of PostgreSQL

   For enhanced security, it is better to have a dedicated group and user for
   running the PostgreSQL server. First, issue as the root user:

 groupadd -g 41 postgres &&
 useradd -c "PostgreSQL Server" -g postgres -d /srv/pgsql/data \
         -u 41 postgres

  Note

   There are several configuration items that add additional functionality
   with optional packages to PostgreSQL. Use ./configure --help to see a
   list.

   Install PostgreSQL with the following commands:

 sed -i '/DEFAULT_PGSOCKET_DIR/s@/tmp@/run/postgresql@' src/include/pg_config_manual.h &&

 ./configure --prefix=/usr          \
             --enable-thread-safety \
             --docdir=/usr/share/doc/postgresql-11.5 &&
 make

   There are a number of programs in the contrib/ directory. If you are going
   to run this installation as a server and wish to build some of them, enter
   make -C contrib or make -C contrib/<SUBDIR-NAME> for each subdirectory.

   Tests must be run as an unprivileged user because they need to start a
   temporary server and this is prevented as the root user. For the same
   reason, you need to stop all PostgreSQL servers if any are running. If a
   previous version of PostgreSQL is installed, it may be necessary to use
   --disable-rpath with configure to avoid failures, but installing the
   binaries created using this switch is not recommended. To test the
   results, issue: make check.

   Now, as the root user:

 make install      &&
 make install-docs

   If you made any of the contrib/ programs, as the root user:

 make -C contrib/<SUBDIR-NAME> install

   If you only intend to use PostgreSQL as a client to connect to a server on
   another machine, your installation is complete and you should not run the
   remaining commands.

   Initialize a database cluster with the following commands issued by the
   root user:

 install -v -dm700 /srv/pgsql/data &&
 install -v -dm755 /run/postgresql &&
 chown -Rv postgres:postgres /srv/pgsql /run/postgresql

   Now, initialize the database as the root user:

 su - postgres -c '/usr/bin/initdb -D /srv/pgsql/data'

  Command Explanations

   sed -i ...: This sed changes server socket location from /tmp to
   /run/postgresql.

   --docdir=/usr/share/doc/postgresql-11.5: This switch puts the
   documentation in a versioned directory.

   --enable-thread-safety: This switch makes the client libraries thread-safe
   by allowing concurrent threads in libpq and ECPG programs to safely
   control their private connection handles.

   --with-openssl: builds the package with support for OpenSSL encrypted
   connections.

   --with-perl: builds the PL/Perl server-side language.

   --with-python: builds the PL/Python server-side language. Add
   PYTHON=/usr/bin/python2 for Python2 support, otherwise Python3 is used by
   default.

   --with-tcl: builds the PL/Tcl server-side language.

  Configuring PostgreSQL

    Config Files

   $PGDATA/pg_ident.con, $PGDATA/pg_hba.conf and $PGDATA/postgresql.conf

   The PGDATA environment variable is used to distinguish database clusters
   from one another by setting it to the value of the directory which
   contains the cluster desired. The three configuration files exist in every
   PGDATA/ directory. Details on the format of the files and the options that
   can be set in each can be found in
   file:///usr/share/doc/postgresql-11.5/html/index.html.

    Boot Script

   Install the /etc/rc.d/init.d/postgresql init script included in the
   blfs-bootscripts-20190609 package.

 make install-postgresql

    Starting the PostgreSQL Server and Creating a Sample Database

   The database server can be manually started with the following command (as
   the root user):

 su - postgres -c '/usr/bin/postgres -D /srv/pgsql/data > \
                   /srv/pgsql/data/logfile 2>&1 &'

  Note

   If you are scripting this part, you should wait for the server to start
   before going on, by adding for example sleep 2 after the above command.

   The instructions below show how to create a database, add a table to it,
   insert some rows into the table and select them, to verify that the
   installation is working properly. Still as user root, issue:

 su - postgres -c '/usr/bin/createdb test' &&
 echo "create table t1 ( name varchar(20), state_province varchar(20) );" \
     | (su - postgres -c '/usr/bin/psql test ') &&
 echo "insert into t1 values ('Billy', 'NewYork');" \
     | (su - postgres -c '/usr/bin/psql test ') &&
 echo "insert into t1 values ('Evanidus', 'Quebec');" \
     | (su - postgres -c '/usr/bin/psql test ') &&
 echo "insert into t1 values ('Jesse', 'Ontario');" \
     | (su - postgres -c '/usr/bin/psql test ') &&
 echo "select * from t1;" | (su - postgres -c '/usr/bin/psql test')

   When you are done with testing, you can shut down the server, by issuing
   as root:

 su - postgres -c "/usr/bin/pg_ctl stop -D /srv/pgsql/data"

                         cluster.                                             
   pg_isready            check the connection status of a PostgreSQL server.  
   pg_receivewal         is used to stream write-ahead logs from a PostgreSQL 
                         server.                                              
   pg_recvlogical        controls PostgreSQL logical decoding streams.        
   pg_resetwal           resets the write-ahead log and other control         
                         information of a PostgreSQL database cluseter.

   pg_rewind             synchronizes a PostgreSQL data directory with        
                         another data directory that was forked from the      
                         first one.                                           
   pg_standby            supports the creation of a PostgreSQL warm standby

      Optional

   libedit and UnZip-6.0 (required to unzip the documentation)

   User Notes: http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/sqlite

  Installation of SQLite

   If you downloaded the optional documentation, issue the following command
   to install the documentation into the source tree:

 unzip -q ../sqlite-doc-3290000.zip

   Install SQLite by running the following commands:

 ./configure --prefix=/usr     \
             --disable-static  \
             --enable-fts5     \
             CFLAGS="-g -O2                    \
             -DSQLITE_ENABLE_FTS3=1            \
             -DSQLITE_ENABLE_FTS4=1            \
             -DSQLITE_ENABLE_COLUMN_METADATA=1 \
             -DSQLITE_ENABLE_UNLOCK_NOTIFY=1   \
             -DSQLITE_ENABLE_DBSTAT_VTAB=1     \
             -DSQLITE_SECURE_DELETE=1          \
             -DSQLITE_ENABLE_FTS3_TOKENIZER=1" &&
 make

   This package does not come with a test suite.

   Now, as the root user:

 make install

   If you downloaded the optional documentation, issue the following commands
   as the root user to install it:

 install -v -m755 -d /usr/share/doc/sqlite-3.29.0 &&
 cp -v -R sqlite-doc-3290000/* /usr/share/doc/sqlite-3.29.0

  Command Explanations

   --disable-static: This switch prevents installation of static versions of
   the libraries.

   --enable-fts5: enable version 5 of the full text search extension.

   CFLAGS="-g -O2 -DSQLITE_ENABLE_FTS3=1 -DSQLITE_ENABLE_FTS4=1
   -DSQLITE_ENABLE_COLUMN_METADATA=1 -DSQLITE_SECURE_DELETE
   -DSQLITE_ENABLE_UNLOCK_NOTIFY=1 -DSQLITE_ENABLE_DBSTAT_VTAB=1":
   Applications such as Firefox require secure delete and enable unlock
   notify to be turned on. Since firefox-41 the dbstat virtual table and
   FTS3/4 are also required. The only way to do this is to include them in
   the CFLAGS. By default, these are set to "-g -O2" so we specify that to
   preserve those settings. You may, of course, wish to omit the '-g' if you
   do not wish to create debugging information. For further information on
   what can be specified see http://www.sqlite.org/compile.html.

   User Notes: http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/openldap

  Installation of OpenLDAP

  Note

   If you only need to install the client side ldap* binaries, corresponding
   man pages, libraries and header files (referred to as a âclient-onlyâ
   install), issue these commands instead of the following ones (no test
   suite available):

 patch -Np1 -i ../openldap-2.4.48-consolidated-1.patch &&
 autoconf &&

 ./configure --prefix=/usr     \
             --sysconfdir=/etc \
             --disable-static  \
             --enable-dynamic  \
             --disable-debug   \
             --disable-slapd &&

 make depend &&
 make

   Then, as the root user:

 make install

 ln -sf ../lib/slapd /usr/sbin/slapd

  Warning

   If upgrading from a previous installation that used Berkeley DB as the
   backend, you will need to dump the database(s) using the slapcat utility,
   relocate all files in /var/lib/openldap, change all instances of bdb to
   mdb in /etc/openldap/slapd.conf and any files in /etc/openldap/slapd.d,
   and import using the slapadd utility after the installation is completed.

   There should be a dedicated user and group to take control of the slapd
   daemon after it is started. Issue the following commands as the root user:

 groupadd -g 83 ldap &&
 useradd  -c "OpenLDAP Daemon Owner" \
          -d /var/lib/openldap -u 83 \
          -g ldap -s /bin/false ldap

   Install OpenLDAP by running the following commands:

 patch -Np1 -i ../openldap-2.4.48-consolidated-1.patch &&
 autoconf &&

 ./configure --prefix=/usr         \
             --sysconfdir=/etc     \
             --localstatedir=/var  \
             --libexecdir=/usr/lib \
             --disable-static      \
             --disable-debug       \
             --with-tls=openssl    \
             --with-cyrus-sasl     \
             --enable-dynamic      \
             --enable-crypt        \
             --enable-spasswd      \
             --enable-slapd        \
             --enable-modules      \
             --enable-rlookups     \
             --enable-backends=mod \
             --disable-ndb         \
             --disable-sql         \
             --disable-shell       \
             --disable-bdb         \
             --disable-hdb         \
             --enable-overlays=mod &&

 make depend &&
 make

   The tests appear to be fragile. Errors may cause the tests to abort prior
   to finishing, apparently due to timing issues. The tests take about 65
   minutes and are processor independent. To test the results, issue: make
   test.

   Now, as the root user:

 make install &&

 sed -e "s/\.la/.so/" -i /etc/openldap/slapd.{conf,ldif}{,.default} &&

 install -v -dm700 -o ldap -g ldap /var/lib/openldap     &&

 install -v -dm700 -o ldap -g ldap /etc/openldap/slapd.d &&
 chmod   -v    640     /etc/openldap/slapd.{conf,ldif}   &&
 chown   -v  root:ldap /etc/openldap/slapd.{conf,ldif}   &&

 install -v -dm755 /usr/share/doc/openldap-2.4.48 &&
 cp      -vfr      doc/{drafts,rfc,guide} \
                   /usr/share/doc/openldap-2.4.48

  Command Explanations

   --disable-static: This switch prevents installation of static versions of
   the libraries.

   --disable-debug: This switch disables the debugging code in OpenLDAP.

   --enable-dynamic: This switch forces the OpenLDAP libraries to be
   dynamically linked to the executable programs.

   --enable-crypt: This switch enables using of crypt(3) passwords.

   --enable-spasswd: This switch enables SASL password verification.

   --enable-modules: This switch enables dynamic module support.

   --enable-rlookups: This switch enables reverse lookups of client
   hostnames.

   --enable-backends: This switch enables all available backends.

   --enable-overlays: This switch enables all available overlays.

   --disable-ndb: This switch disables MySQL NDB Cluster backend which causes
   configure to fail if MySQL is present.

   --disable-sql: This switch explicitly disables the SQL backend. Omit this
   switch if a SQL server is installed and you are going to use a SQL
   backend.

   --libexecdir=/usr/lib: This switch controls where the /usr/lib/openldap
   directory is installed. Everything in that directory is a library, so it
   belongs under /usr/lib instead of /usr/libexec.

   --enable-slp: This switch enables SLPv2 support. Use it if you have
   installed OpenSLP.

  Note

   You can run ./configure --help to see if there are other switch you can
   pass to the configure command to enable other options or dependency
   packages.

   install ..., chown ..., and chmod ...: Having slapd configuration files
   and ldap databases in /var/lib/openldap readable by anyone is a SECURITY
   ISSUE, especially since a file stores the admin password in PLAIN TEXT.
   That's why mode 640 and root:ldap ownership were used. The owner is root,
   so only root can modify the file, and group is ldap, so that the group
   which owns slapd daemon could read but not modify the file in case of a
   security breach.

  Configuring OpenLDAP

    Config Files

     * For LDAP client: /etc/openldap/ldap.conf and ~/.ldaprc

     * For LDAP server, two configuration mechanisms are used: a legacy
       /etc/openldap/slapd.conf configuration file and the recommended
       slapd-config system, using an LDIF database stored in
       /etc/openldap/slapd.d.

    Configuration Information

   Configuring the slapd servers can be complex. Securing the LDAP directory,
   especially if you are storing non-public data such as password databases,
   can also be a challenging task. In order to set up OpenLDAP, you'll need
   to modify either the /etc/openldap/slapd.conf file (old method), or the
   /etc/openldap/slapd.ldif file and then use ldapadd to create de LDAP
   configuration database in /etc/openldap/slapd.d (recommended by the
   OpenLDAP documentation).

  Note

   The instructions above install an empty LDAP structure and a default
   /etc/openldap/slapd.conf file, which are suitable for testing the build
   and other packages using LDAP. Do not use them on a production server.

   Resources to assist you with topics such as choosing a directory
   configuration, backend and database definitions, access control settings,
   running as a user other than root and setting a chroot environment
   include:

     * The slapd(8) man page.

     * The slapd.conf(5) and slapd-config(5) man pages.

     * The OpenLDAP 2.4 Administrator's Guide (also installed locally in
       /usr/share/doc/openldap-2.4.48/guide/admin).

     * Documents located at http://www.openldap.org/pub/.

    Mozilla Address Directory

   By default, LDAPv2 support is disabled in the slapd.conf file. Once the
   database is properly set up and Mozilla is configured to use the
   directory, you must add allow bind_v2 to the slapd.conf file.

    Boot Script

   To automate the startup of the LDAP server at system bootup, install the
   /etc/rc.d/init.d/slapd init script included in the
   blfs-bootscripts-20190609 package using the following command:

 make install-slapd

  Note

   You'll need to modify the /etc/sysconfig/slapd to include the parameters
   needed for your specific configuration. See the slapd man page for
   parameter information.

    Testing the Configuration

   Start the LDAP server using the init script:

 /etc/rc.d/init.d/slapd start

   Verify access to the LDAP server with the following command:

 ldapsearch -x -b '' -s base '(objectclass=*)' namingContexts

   The expected result is:

 # extended LDIF
 #
 # LDAPv3
 # base <> with scope baseObject
 # filter: (objectclass=*)
 # requesting: namingContexts
 #

 #
 dn:
 namingContexts: dc=my-domain,dc=com

   slapcat      is used to generate an LDAP LDIF output based upon the        
                contents of a slapd database.                                 
   slapd        is the standalone LDAP server.                                
   slapdn       checks a list of string-represented DNs based on schema

   liblber.so   is a set of Lightweight Basic Encoding Rules routines. These  
                routines are used by the LDAP library routines to encode and  
                decode LDAP protocol elements using the (slightly simplified) 
                Basic Encoding Rules defined by LDAP. They are not normally   
                used directly by an LDAP application program except in the    
                handling of controls and extended operations.                 
   libldap.so   supports the LDAP programs and provide functionality for      
                other programs interacting with LDAP.                         
   libldap_r.so contains the functions required by the LDAP programs to

Unbound-1.9.2

  Introduction to Unbound

   Unbound is a validating, recursive, and caching DNS resolver. It is
   designed as a set of modular components that incorporate modern features,
   such as enhanced security (DNSSEC) validation, Internet Protocol Version 6
   (IPv6), and a client resolver library API as an integral part of the
   architecture.

   This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS-9.0
   platform.

     * Download MD5 sum: 244e10977d1453dff669caa3c0efba18

     * Download size: 5.4 MB

     * Estimated disk space required: 52 MB (add 9 MB for tests and 71 MB for
       documentation)

     * Estimated build time: 0.4 SBU (Using parallelism=4; add 0.3 SBU for
       tests)

    Unbound Dependencies

      Optional

   libevent-2.1.11, Nettle-3.5.1, Python-2.7.16, SWIG-4.0.0 (for Python
   bindings), Doxygen-1.8.16 (for html documentation), dnstap, and Sphinx
   (for Python bindings documentation)

   User Notes: http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/unbound

  Installation of Unbound

   There should be a dedicated user and group to take control of the unbound
   daemon after it is started. Issue the following commands as the root user:

 groupadd -g 88 unbound &&
 useradd -c "Unbound DNS resolver" -d /var/lib/unbound -u 88 \
         -g unbound -s /bin/false unbound

   Install Unbound by running the following commands:

 ./configure --prefix=/usr     \
             --sysconfdir=/etc \
             --disable-static  \
             --with-pidfile=/run/unbound.pid &&
 make

   If you have Doxygen-1.8.16 package installed and want to build html
   documentation, run the following command:

 make doc

   To test the results, issue make check.

   Now, as the root user:

 make install &&
 mv -v /usr/sbin/unbound-host /usr/bin/

   If you built the documentation, install it by running the following
   commands as the root user:

 install -v -m755 -d /usr/share/doc/unbound-1.9.2 &&
 install -v -m644 doc/html/* /usr/share/doc/unbound-1.9.2

  Command Explanations

   --disable-static: This switch prevents installation of static versions of
   the libraries.

   --with-libevent: This option enables libevent support allowing use of
   large outgoing port ranges.

   --with-pyunbound: This option enables building of the Python bindings.

  Configuring Unbound

    Config Files

   /etc/unbound/unbound.conf

    Configuration Information

   In the default configuration, unbound will bind to localhost (127.0.0.1 IP
   address) and allow recursive queries only from localhost clients. If you
   want to use unbound for local DNS resolution, run the following command as
   the root user:

 echo "nameserver 127.0.0.1" > /etc/resolv.conf

   If you are using a DHCP client for connecting to a network,
   /etc/resolv.conf gets overwritten with values provided by DHCP server. You
   can override this, for example in DHCP-4.4.1, by running the following
   command as the root user:

 sed -i '/request /i\supersede domain-name-servers 127.0.0.1;' \
        /etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf

   For advanced configuration see /etc/unbound/unbound.conf file and the
   documentation.

   When Unbound is installed, some package builds fail if the file
   /etc/unbound/root.key is not found. This file is created by running the
   boot script (install instructions below). Alternatively, it can be created
   by running the following command as the root user:

 unbound-anchor

    Boot Script

   If you want the Unbound server to start automatically when the system is
   booted, install the /etc/rc.d/init.d/unbound init script included in the
   blfs-bootscripts-20190609 package.

 make install-unbound

  Contents

   Installed Programs: unbound, unbound-anchor, unbound-checkconf,
   unbound-control, unbound-control-setup, and unbound-host
   Installed Library: libunbound.so and (optional)
   /usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/_unbound.so
   Installed Directories: /etc/unbound and /usr/share/doc/unbound-1.9.2
   (optional)

    Short Descriptions

   unbound               is a DNS resolver daemon.                            
   unbound-anchor        performs setup or update of the root trust anchor    
                         for DNSSEC validation.                               
   unbound-checkconf     checks unbound configuration file for syntax and     
                         other errors.                                        
   unbound-control       performs remote administration on the unbound DNS    
                         resolver.                                            
   unbound-control-setup generates self-signed certificate and private keys   
                         for the server and client.                           
   unbound-host          is a DNS lookup utility similar to host from BIND    
                         Utilities-9.14.5.                                    
   libunbound.so         provides the Unbound API functions to programs.

                    Part VI. X + Window and Display Managers

Chapter 24. X Window System Environment

   This chapter contains instructions to build and configure a graphical user
   environment.

   Xorg, in addition to clearing up some licensing issues with XFree86,
   introduced a completely auto-tooled build for the X Window system. This
   means that the packages build and install using the conventional
   configure, make, and make install commands, as opposed to a proprietary
   build system that required hand editing of configuration parameters in a
   C-like syntax.

   Xorg also brought with it a modular build system. While this separation
   into modules resulted in full control of the features available to the X
   server on any given installation, it also made the installation more
   tedious as it requires installing more than 100 different packages to
   obtain a functional X Window environment. Most large commercial
   distributions have elected to use Xorg over the XFree86 distribution due
   to both licensing issues and the increased functionality provided by it
   over XFree86. With the modular build system, also came incremental updates
   to individual packages. The distribution of Xorg is given a release number
   by the developers, in this case Xorg-7, and is referred to as the
   "katamari" by the upstream developers.

Introduction to Xorg-7

   Xorg is a freely redistributable, open-source implementation of the X
   Window System. This system provides a client/server interface between
   display hardware (the mouse, keyboard, and video displays) and the desktop
   environment, while also providing both the windowing infrastructure and a
   standardized application interface (API).

   User Notes: http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/Xorg7

    Xorg Download and Installation Instructions

   Xorg-7.0 introduced a completely auto-tooled, modular build system. With
   the new modular build system, it is no longer possible to download the
   entire package in a single file. In fact, there will be well over 100
   packages that need to be fetched from the download location. To assist
   with such a large task, installing Wget-1.20.3 is strongly recommended for
   downloading the needed files. A complete wget file list is provided for
   each page that includes multiple packages.

   Given the number of packages available, deciding which packages you need
   to install for your particular setup may seem a bit overwhelming at first.
   Take a look at this page and this thread to get an idea of what you will
   need. If you are unsure, you should install all packages at the cost of
   extra disk space.

  Note

   Even if you intend to download only the necessary packages, you should
   download the wget file lists. The list of files are ordered by dependency,
   and the package versions listed in the files are known to work well with
   each other. Further, the wget file lists contain comments for specific
   packages that are deprecated or are not recommended to install. Newer
   packages are likely intended for the next release of Xorg and have already
   proved to be incompatible with current versions of software installed in
   BLFS. The installed size of Xorg can be reduced considerably by installing
   only the packages that you will need and use, however, the BLFS book
   cannot account for all dependencies and build options for the individual
   Xorg packages. The instructions assume that all packages have been built.
   A wiki page containing dependency information is under development. You
   are encouraged to add to these pages if you discover additional
   information that may be helpful to other users who selectively install
   individual packages.

   Additionally, because of the large number of repetitive commands, you are
   encouraged to partially automate the build. Instructions have been given
   that utilize the Sudo-1.8.27 package. It is recommended that you use the
   :NOPASSWD configuration option for the user that will be building the xorg
   packages.

  Setting up the Xorg Build Environment

  Note

   The following instructions assume that the shell startup files have been
   set up as described in The Bash Shell Startup Files.

   First, you'll need to create a working directory:

 mkdir xc &&
 cd xc

   As with previous releases of the X Window System, it may be desirable to
   install Xorg into an alternate prefix. This is no longer common practice
   among Linux distributions. The common installation prefix for Xorg on
   Linux is /usr. There is no standard alternate prefix, nor is there any
   exception in the current revision of the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard for
   Release 7 of the X Window System. Alan Coopersmith of Sun Microsystems,
   has recently stated "At Sun, we were using /usr/X11 and plan to stick with
   it." Only the /opt/* prefix or the /usr prefix adhere to the current FHS
   guidelines.

   Choose your installation prefix, and set the XORG_PREFIX variable with the
   following command:

 export XORG_PREFIX="<PREFIX>"

   Throughout these instructions, you will use the following configure
   switches for all of the packages. Create the XORG_CONFIG variable to use
   for this parameter substitution:

 export XORG_CONFIG="--prefix=$XORG_PREFIX --sysconfdir=/etc \
     --localstatedir=/var --disable-static"

   Create an /etc/profile.d/xorg.sh configuration file containing these
   variables as the root user:

 cat > /etc/profile.d/xorg.sh << EOF
 XORG_PREFIX="$XORG_PREFIX"
 XORG_CONFIG="--prefix=\$XORG_PREFIX --sysconfdir=/etc --localstatedir=/var --disable-static"
 export XORG_PREFIX XORG_CONFIG
 EOF
 chmod 644 /etc/profile.d/xorg.sh

  Note

   There is some confustion about the above 'here' document. The backslash in
   front of the dollar sign is correct. Bash will remove it when creating
   /etc/profile.d/xorg.sh. However, if you are creating the file with an
   editor, a copy and paste operation will not remove the baskslash. It must
   then be removed manually.

  Note

   If you've decided to use the standard /usr prefix, you can omit the
   remainder of this page and continue at util-macros-1.19.2.

   If you've decided to not use the standard prefix, be sure to add
   $XORG_PREFIX/bin to your PATH environment variable, and
   $XORG_PREFIX/lib/pkgconfig and $XORG_PREFIX/share/pkgconfig to your
   PKG_CONFIG_PATH variable. It is also helpful to specify additional search
   paths for gcc and an include directory for the aclocal program. Issue the
   following commands as the root user:

 cat >> /etc/profile.d/xorg.sh << "EOF"
 pathappend $XORG_PREFIX/bin             PATH
 pathappend $XORG_PREFIX/lib/pkgconfig   PKG_CONFIG_PATH
 pathappend $XORG_PREFIX/share/pkgconfig PKG_CONFIG_PATH

 pathappend $XORG_PREFIX/lib             LIBRARY_PATH
 pathappend $XORG_PREFIX/include         C_INCLUDE_PATH
 pathappend $XORG_PREFIX/include         CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH

 ACLOCAL="aclocal -I $XORG_PREFIX/share/aclocal"

 export PATH PKG_CONFIG_PATH ACLOCAL LIBRARY_PATH C_INCLUDE_PATH CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH
 EOF

   The script above needs to be activated. Normally it will be automatic at
   login, but to activate it now, as a regular user, run:

 source /etc/profile.d/xorg.sh

   You should also add $XORG_PREFIX/lib to the /etc/ld.so.conf file. Again,
   as the root user, issue the following command:

 echo "$XORG_PREFIX/lib" >> /etc/ld.so.conf

   You should also modify /etc/man_db.conf, adding appropriate
   MANDATORY_MANPATH, MANPATH_MAP, and MANDB_MAP entries following the
   examples for /usr/X11R6. Issue the following command as the root user:

 sed "s@/usr/X11R6@$XORG_PREFIX@g" -i /etc/man_db.conf

   Some applications look for shared files in /usr/share/X11. Create a
   symbolic link to the proper location as the root user:

 ln -svf $XORG_PREFIX/share/X11 /usr/share/X11

   If building KDE, some cmake files look for Xorg in places other than
   $XORG_PREFIX. Allow cmake to find Xorg with:

 ln -svf $XORG_PREFIX /usr/X11R6

    xorgproto Dependencies

      Required

   util-macros-1.19.2

      Optional

   fop-2.3, libxslt-1.1.33, xmlto-0.0.28 and asciidoc-8.6.9 (to build
   additional documentation)

  Note

   There is a reciprocal dependency with fop-2.3. If you wish to build the
   documentation, you'll need to re-install the Protocol Headers after the
   installation is complete and fop-2.3 has been installed.

   User Notes:
   http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/Xorg7ProtocolHeaders

  Installation of xorgproto

   Install xorgproto by running the following commands:

 mkdir build &&
 cd    build &&

 meson --prefix=$XORG_PREFIX .. &&
 ninja

   This package does not come with a test suite.

   Now, as the root user:

 ninja install &&

 install -vdm 755 $XORG_PREFIX/share/doc/xorgproto-2019.1 &&
 install -vm 644 ../[^m]*.txt ../PM_spec $XORG_PREFIX/share/doc/xorgproto-2019.1

  Command Explanations

   install -vm 644 ../[^m]*.txt ../PM_spec ...: The meson build system does
   not install the text files into /usr/share/doc. The [^m] part prevents
   copying the meson_config.txt file.

libxcb-1.13.1

  Introduction to libxcb

   The libxcb package provides an interface to the X Window System protocol,
   which replaces the current Xlib interface. Xlib can also use XCB as a
   transport layer, allowing software to make requests and receive responses
   with both.

   This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS-9.0
   platform.

      Optional

   Doxygen-1.8.16 (to generate API documentation) and libxslt-1.1.33

   User Notes: http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/libxcb

  Installation of libxcb

   Install libxcb by running the following commands:

 sed -i "s/pthread-stubs//" configure &&

 ./configure $XORG_CONFIG      \
             --without-doxygen \
             --docdir='${datadir}'/doc/libxcb-1.13.1 &&
 make

   To test the results, issue: make check.

   Now, as the root user:

 make install

  Command Explanations

   sed "s/pthread-stubs//" -i configure: This sed removes a dependency on the
   libpthread-stubs package which is useless on Linux.

   --without-doxygen: Do not use doxygen to generate API documentation
   (default: auto). Without it, if Doxygen-1.8.16 is installed, the API
   documentation will be generated and installed.

   To download the needed files using wget, use the following commands:

 mkdir lib &&
 cd lib &&
 grep -v '^#' ../lib-7.md5 | awk '{print $2}' | wget -i- -c \
     -B https://www.x.org/pub/individual/lib/ &&
 md5sum -c ../lib-7.md5

  Installation of Xorg Libraries

  Note

   When installing multiple packages in a script, the installation needs to
   be done as the root user. There are three general options that can be used
   to do this:

    1. Run the entire script as the root user (not recommended).

    2. Use the sudo command from the Sudo-1.8.27 package.

    3. Use su -c "command arguments" (quotes required) which will ask for the
       root password for every iteration of the loop.

   One way to handle this situation is to create a short bash function that
   automatically selects the appropriate method. Once the command is set in
   the environment, it does not need to be set again.

 as_root()
 {
   if   [ $EUID = 0 ];        then $*
   elif [ -x /usr/bin/sudo ]; then sudo $*
   else                            su -c \\"$*\\"
   fi
 }

 export -f as_root

   Some libraries come with a test suite. If you wish to execute them, either
   comment out the rm -rf ... below, so that, after all libraries are
   installed, you can come back to the corresponding directory and run make
   check, or do individual builds, running the tests for each of those
   distributed with working test suites. Alternatively, you can uncomment the
   line #make check ..., and at the end, check the test results with:

 grep -A9 summary *make_check.log

   BLFS developers have confirmed that libX11, libXt and libxshmfence are
   distributed with working test suites.

   First, start a subshell that will exit on error:

 bash -e

   Install all of the packages by running the following commands:

 for package in $(grep -v '^#' ../lib-7.md5 | awk '{print $2}')
 do
   packagedir=${package%.tar.bz2}
   tar -xf $package
   pushd $packagedir
   case $packagedir in
     libICE* )
       ./configure $XORG_CONFIG ICE_LIBS=-lpthread
     ;;

     libXfont2-[0-9]* )
       ./configure $XORG_CONFIG --disable-devel-docs
     ;;

     libXt-[0-9]* )
       ./configure $XORG_CONFIG \
                   --with-appdefaultdir=/etc/X11/app-defaults
     ;;

     * )
       ./configure $XORG_CONFIG
     ;;
   esac
   make
   #make check 2>&1 | tee ../$packagedir-make_check.log
   as_root make install
   popd
   rm -rf $packagedir
   as_root /sbin/ldconfig
 done

   Finally, exit the shell that was started earlier:

 exit

  Command Explanations

   ./configure $XORG_CONFIG ICE_LIBS=-lpthread: This fixes a change in glibc
   which breaks pulseaudio at runtime.

   --disable-devel-docs: Disable generation of text documentation in the
   libXfont2 package if xmlto-0.0.28 is installed without a text browser.
   Omit this parameter (or the entire case statement) if a text browser is
   installed.

   --with-fop: Use fop-2.3 to generate PDF documentation (only for the
   libXfont package).

  Configuration of Xorg Libraries

   If you've chosen to install Xorg into /usr, then no further configuration
   is necessary and you can skip the rest of this section. If you've opted
   for an alternate prefix, you should create two symlinks to satisfy the
   expected environment of several packages. Execute the following commands
   as the root user:

 ln -sv $XORG_PREFIX/lib/X11 /usr/lib/X11 &&
 ln -sv $XORG_PREFIX/include/X11 /usr/include/X11

Mesa-19.1.4

  Introduction to Mesa

   Mesa is an OpenGL compatible 3D graphics library.

  Note

   Mesa is updated relatively often. You may want to use the latest available
   19.1.x mesa version.

   This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS-9.0
   platform.

    Package Information

     * Download (HTTP):
       https://mesa.freedesktop.org/archive/mesa-19.1.4.tar.xz

     * Download MD5 sum: 90eed05e3239c96ad9e92eb11eb67ada

     * Download size: 10 MB

     * Estimated disk space required: 350 MB (with demos and docs), add 147
       MB if tests are enabled

     * Estimated build time: 2.3 SBU (with parallelism=4, demos, and docs),
       add 0.5 SBU if tests are enabled

    Additional Downloads

     * Recommended patch:
       http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/patches/blfs/9.0/mesa-19.1.4-add_xdemos-1.patch
       (installs 2 demo programs for testing Mesa - not needed if you install
       the mesa-demos package)

    Mesa Dependencies

      Required

   Xorg Libraries, libdrm-2.4.99, and Mako-1.1.0

      Recommended

   libva-2.5.0 (to provide VA-API support for some gallium drivers, note that
   there is a circular dependency. You must build libva first without EGL and
   GLX support, install this package, and rebuild libva), libvdpau-1.2 (to
   build VDPAU drivers), LLVM-8.0.1 (required for Gallium3D, nouveau, r300,
   and radeonsi drivers and for swrast, the software rasterizer which is
   sometimes referred to as llvmpipe. See http://www.mesa3d.org/systems.html
   for more information), and wayland-protocols-1.18 (required for
   Plasma-5.16.4, GNOME, and recommended for GTK+-3.24.10)

      Optional

   libgcrypt-1.8.5, lm_sensors-3.4.0 , Nettle-3.5.1, Valgrind-3.15.0,
   mesa-demos (provides more than 300 extra demos to test Mesa; this includes
   the same programs added by the patch above), Bellagio OpenMAX Integration
   Layer (for mobile platforms), and libtizonia

  Note

   The instructions below assume that LLVM with the r600/amdgpu and host
   backends and run-time type information (RTTI - needed for nouveau) are
   installed. You will need to modify the instructions if you choose not to
   install all of these. For an explanation of Gallium3D see
   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallium3D.

   User Notes: http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/mesa

  Installation of Mesa

   If you have downloaded the xdemos patch (needed if testing the Xorg
   installation per BLFS instructions), apply it by running the following
   command:

 patch -Np1 -i ../mesa-19.1.4-add_xdemos-1.patch

  Note

   The measurements above, and the Contents below, are for a full build. Many
   people will not wish to install drivers they cannot use, so the following
   paragraphs explain how to limit the drivers, and give an example which can
   be be reduced or amended as necessary.

   Now, select the drivers you wish to install. For the X86 architecture, the
   available gallium drivers are auto, or alternatively a choice from i915,
   nouveau, r300, r600, radeonsi, svga, swrast, and virgl. The latter is
   recommended if you intend to run the system under qemu-4.1.0. If you wish
   to build all available gallium drivers, use 'auto'.

   The (non-gallium) DRI drivers available in X86 are auto, or alternatively
   a choice from i915, i965, nouveau, r100, r200, and swrast. Use 'auto' to
   build all available DRI drivers, or use an empty string (DRI_DRIVERS="")
   if you wish to only build gallium drivers.

   The platforms ("window systems") available for X86 linux are x11, wayland,
   drm, and surfaceless. By not specifying anything, the meson build-system
   will build for all these platforms if you have the dependencies, identical
   to if you had specified '-Dplatforms=auto'.

   Modify the commands below for your desired drivers. The drivers listed
   below will cover most modern video cards and virtual machines. For help in
   selecting drivers see http://www.mesa3d.org/systems.html.

  Note

   Although the nouveau drivers can be built for both gallium and dri, the
   i915 driver can only be built for one or the other.

 GALLIUM_DRV="i915,nouveau,r600,radeonsi,svga,swrast,virgl"
 DRI_DRIVERS="i965,nouveau"

   Install Mesa by running the following commands:

 mkdir build &&
 cd    build &&

 meson --prefix=$XORG_PREFIX          \
       -Dbuildtype=release            \
       -Ddri-drivers=$DRI_DRIVERS     \
       -Dgallium-drivers=$GALLIUM_DRV \
       -Dgallium-nine=false           \
       -Dglx=dri                      \
       -Dosmesa=gallium               \
       -Dvalgrind=false               \
       ..                             &&

 unset GALLIUM_DRV DRI_DRIVERS &&

 ninja

   If you built the tests (see 'Command Explanations'), to run them issue:
   ninja test.

   Now, as the root user:

 ninja install

   If desired, install the optional documentation by running the following
   commands as the root user:

 install -v -dm755 /usr/share/doc/mesa-19.1.4 &&
 cp -rfv ../docs/* /usr/share/doc/mesa-19.1.4

  Command Explanations

   -Dbuildtype=release: This switch ensures a fully-optimized build, and
   disables debug assertions which will severely slow down the libraries in
   certain use-cases.

   -Ddri-drivers="...": This parameter controls which (non-gallium) dri
   drivers should be built.

   -Dgallium-drivers="...": This parameter controls which Gallium3D drivers
   should be built.

   -Dgallium-nine=true: This switch provides support for (MS Windows) games
   designed for DX9. It requires swrast.

   -Dosmesa=gallium: This switch enables building the libOSMesa library and
   provides Gallium3D support in it.

   -Dvalgrind=false: This parameter disables the usage of Valgrind during the
   build process. Remove this parameter if you have Valgrind installed, and
   wish to check for memory leaks.

   -Dbuild-tests=true: This option will cause the test code to be enabled.

  Installation of Xorg Applications

  Note

   When installing multiple packages in a script, the installation needs to
   be done as the root user. There are three general options that can be used
   to do this:

    1. Run the entire script as the root user (not recommended).

    2. Use the sudo command from the Sudo-1.8.27 package.

    3. Use su -c "command arguments" (quotes required) which will ask for the
       root password for every iteration of the loop.

   One way to handle this situation is to create a short bash function that
   automatically selects the appropriate method. Once the command is set in
   the environment, it does not need to be set again.

 as_root()
 {
   if   [ $EUID = 0 ];        then $*
   elif [ -x /usr/bin/sudo ]; then sudo $*
   else                            su -c \\"$*\\"
   fi
 }

 export -f as_root

   First, start a subshell that will exit on error:

 bash -e

   Install all of the packages by running the following commands:

 for package in $(grep -v '^#' ../app-7.md5 | awk '{print $2}')
 do
   packagedir=${package%.tar.?z*}
   tar -xf $package
   pushd $packagedir
      case $packagedir in
        luit-[0-9]* )
          sed -i -e "/D_XOPEN/s/5/6/" configure
        ;;
      esac

      ./configure $XORG_CONFIG
      make
      as_root make install
   popd
   rm -rf $packagedir
 done

   Finally, exit the shell that was started earlier:

 exit

   Unless you installed the optional dependencies, remove an undocumented
   script which is reported to be broken (xkeystone provided by the xrandr
   package).

 as_root rm -f $XORG_PREFIX/bin/xkeystone

   When all of the fonts have been installed, the system must be configured
   so that Fontconfig can find the TrueType fonts since they are outside of
   the default search path of /usr/share/fonts. Make symlinks to the Xorg
   TrueType font directories by running the following commands as the root
   user:

 make

   To test the results, issue: make check. You will need to run ldconfig as
   the root user first or some tests may fail.

   Now as the root user:

 make install &&
 mkdir -pv /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d &&
 cat >> /etc/sysconfig/createfiles << "EOF"
 /tmp/.ICE-unix dir 1777 root root
 /tmp/.X11-unix dir 1777 root root
 EOF

  Command Explanations

   --enable-glamor: Build the Glamor DIX (Device Independent X) module which
   is currently used by: R600 or later radeon video chipsets, the modesetting
   driver (which is part of this package) for hardware using KMS which offers
   acceleration, and (optionally) the intel driver.

   --enable-suid-wrapper: Build suid-root wrapper for legacy driver support
   on rootless xserver systems.

   --disable-systemd-logind: This switch disables elogind integration
   allowing Xorg Server to work without having the PAM module configured.

   --enable-install-setuid: This switch restores the setuid bit to the Xorg
   executable allowing Xorg Server to work with a virtual terminal designated
   on the startx command line.

   cat >> /etc/sysconfig/createfiles...: This command creates the
   /tmp/.ICE-unix and /tmp/.X11-unix directories at startup, and ensures that
   the permissions and ownership are correct as required by the server.

Xorg Drivers

  Introduction to Xorg Drivers

   The Xorg Drivers page contains the instructions for building Xorg drivers
   that are necessary in order for Xorg Server to take advantage of the
   hardware that it is running on. At least one input and one video driver
   are required for Xorg Server to start.

   On machines using KMS, the modesetting driver is provided by xorg-server
   and can be used instead of the video driver for the specific hardware, but
   with reduced performance. It can also be used (without hardware
   acceleration) in virtual machines running under qemu.

  Note

   If you are unsure which video hardware you have, you can use lspci from
   pciutils-3.6.2 to find out which video hardware you have and then look at
   the descriptions of the packages in order to find out which driver you
   need.

  Note

   In addition to the drivers listed below, there are several other drivers
   for very old hardware that may still be relevant. The latest versions of
   these drivers may be downloaded from
   https://www.x.org/archive/individual/driver. Instructions for building
   these now intermittently maintained drivers may be found in a prior
   version of BLFS:

        Optional

   Valgrind-3.15.0 (to run the tests), Sphinx (required to build
   documentation), GTK+-3.24.10 (to build the GUI event viewer), libunwind
   (required for tests), libwacom-0.29, and PyParsing (for one non-root test)

   User Notes: http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/libinput

    kernel configuration for running the libinput testsuite

   Although libinput works with the same kernel configuration used by
   libevdev-1.7.0, its extensive testsuite requires the presence of
   /dev/uinput (as well as both Valgrind-3.15.0 and libunwind).

   If you wish to run the full tests, enable the following option in the
   kernel configuration and recompile the kernel if necessary:

 Device Drivers --->
   Input device support --->
     Miscellaneous Devices --->
     <*/M>   User level driver support        [CONFIG_INPUT_UINPUT]

   If you build this as a module, it needs to be inserted before the
   testsuite runs.

   On an Xorg system you will also need to prevent the events generated
   during the testsuite from interfering with your desktop. Copy the file
   test/50-litest.conf into ${XORG_PREFIX}/share/X11/xorg.conf.d and restart
   X. For further information see libinput test suite.

    Installation of libinput

   Install libinput by running the following commands:

 mkdir build &&
 cd    build &&

 meson --prefix=$XORG_PREFIX \
       -Dudev-dir=/lib/udev  \
       -Ddebug-gui=false     \
       -Dtests=false         \
       -Ddocumentation=false \
       -Dlibwacom=false      \
       ..                    &&
 ninja

  Note

   If you want to run the full tests, remove -Dtests from the meson command
   above. Please read "kernel configuration for running the libinput
   testsuite" (above).

   If you have enabled the full tests, you can run the main tests as the root
   user by executing: ninja test. A very large number of tests will be run,
   about 20 fail (at least on an Xorg system).

   Now, as the root user:

 ninja install

   If Doxygen-1.8.16, Graphviz-2.40.1, and Sphinx were present during the
   build, you can install the generated documentation by running the
   following commands as the root user:

 install -v -dm755      /usr/share/doc/libinput-1.14.0/{html,api} &&
 cp -rv Documentation/* /usr/share/doc/libinput-1.14.0/html &&
 cp -rv api/*           /usr/share/doc/libinput-1.14.0/api

    Command Explanations

   -Dudev-dir=/lib/udev: This switch specifies where UDev rules and hwdb
   files will be installed.

   -Ddebug-gui=false: This switch disables creation of a visual debug helper
   for libinput. Remove if you want it, and you have GTK+-3.24.10 installed.

   -Dtests=false: This switch disables compilation of the main tests. Even
   with the tests defined as false, you can still run the first four minor
   tests, as a regular user, but one will be skipped if PyParsing is not
   installed.

   -Ddocumentation=false: This switch disables generation of the
   documentation. Remove if you want to generate it, and you have
   Doxygen-1.8.16 and Graphviz-2.40.1 installed.

   -Dlibwacom=false: Remove this option if you have the external library
   libwacom installed.

   This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS-9.0
   platform.

  Note

   For Direct Rendering to work, you need to enable the radeonsi Gallium
   driver at Mesa-19.1.4 build time. Also, all cards require Firmware to be
   available when the kernel driver is loaded. Firmware can be obtained from
   http://anduin.linuxfromscratch.org/BLFS/linux-firmware/. See the section
   called âKernel Configuration for additional firmwareâ below for additional

   User Notes: http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/xorg-amdgpu-driver

    Kernel Configuration

   Enable the following options in the kernel configuration and recompile the
   kernel if necessary:

 Device Drivers  --->
   Graphics support --->
    <*> Direct Rendering Manager (XFree86 ... support) ---> [CONFIG_DRM]
    <*/M> AMD GPU                                           [CONFIG_DRM_AMDGPU]

     [ /*] Enable amdgpu support for CIK parts              [CONFIG_DRM_AMDGPU_CIK]

   The last two options enable experimental support for Southern and Sea
   Islands AMD GPUs so they can be used with this driver. Note that the
   support is marked experimental and disabled by default. Xorg ATI
   Driver-19.0.1 should be used for those GPUs.

    Kernel Configuration for additional firmware

   If you need to add firmware, install the file(s) and then point to them in
   the kernel configuration and recompile the kernel if necessary. To find
   out which firmware you need, consult the Decoder ring for engineering vs
   marketing names. Download any firmware for your card which is named like:
   <ENGINEERING_NAME>_rlc.bin, etc. Below is an example for Radeon R7 M340
   GPU, which is codenamed Iceland/Topaz, along with a network card that also
   requires the firmware:

  Tip

   You can check dmesg output after boot to see which firmware is missing.

   Alternatively, if you change CONFIG_DRM_AMDGPU to '=m' in your linux
   kernel .config the firmware can be loaded automatically from
   /lib/firmware/amdgpu/ when it installs the module. This offers a tiny
   space saving, but also means that the screen will be blank for a longer
   time before the framebuffer appears. Distros take this approach because it
   is not practical to specify every possible firmware and the kernel would
   be excessively big.

  Xorg ATI Driver-19.0.1

    Introduction to Xorg ATI Driver

   The Xorg ATI Driver package contains the X.Org Video Driver for ATI Radeon
   video cards including all chipsets ranging from R100 to the "Volcanic
   Islands" chipsets.

   This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS-9.0
   platform.

  Note

   For Direct Rendering to work with newer Radeon Cards (R300 and later
   chipsets), you need to enable the r300, r600 and radeonsi Gallium drivers
   at Mesa-19.1.4 build time. Also, some cards require Firmware to be
   available when the kernel driver is loaded. Firmware can be obtained from
   http://anduin.linuxfromscratch.org/BLFS/linux-firmware/. See the section
   called âKernel Configuration for additional firmwareâ below for additional
   firmware.

  Note

   Glamor is required for Southern, Sea or Volcanic Islands GPUs, and used by
   default in all other R600 or later radeon GPUs. To see which GPUs are in
   these categories, read the Decoder ring for engineering vs marketing
   names.

    Kernel Configuration

   Enable the following options in the kernel configuration and recompile the
   kernel if necessary:

 Device Drivers  --->
   Graphics support --->
    <*> Direct Rendering Manager (XFree86 ... support) ---> [CONFIG_DRM]
    <*> ATI Radeon                                          [CONFIG_DRM_RADEON]

    Kernel Configuration for additional firmware

   If you need to add firmware, install the file(s) and then point to them in
   the kernel configuration and recompile the kernel if necessary. To find
   out which firmware you need, consult the Decoder ring for engineering vs
   marketing names. Download any firmware for your card which is named like:
   <ENGINEERING_NAME>_rlc.bin, etc. Note that for R600 and R700 family,
   generic R600_rlc.bin and R700_rlc.bin are necessary in addition to the
   model specific firmware, while for later generations you need the
   BTC_rlc.bin in addition to the model specific firmware. Below is an
   example for a Radeon HD6470 which is a "Northern Islands" GPU, plus an RTL
   network chip that also requests extra firmware:

 CONFIG_EXTRA_FIRMWARE="radeon/BTC_rlc.bin radeon/CAICOS_mc.bin radeon/CAICOS_me.bin
 radeon/CAICOS_pfp.bin radeon/CAICOS_smc.bin rtl_nic/rtl8168e-3.fw"
 CONFIG_EXTRA_FIRMWARE_DIR="/lib/firmware"

  Note

   CONFIG_EXTRA_FIRMWARE should all be on one line. It is shown above as two
   lines for presentation only.

  Tip

   You can check dmesg output after boot to see which firmware is missing.

   Alternatively, if you change CONFIG_DRM_RADEON to '=m' in your .config the
   firmware can be loaded automatically from /lib/firmware/radeon when it

    Working around problems with the Intel driver

   The SandyBridge New Acceleration (SNA) code is intended to replace the old
   UXA (UMA Acceleration Architecture), but it is a large body of code and
   may cause problems. However, the version of the code in the version
   control system listed above has been tested successfully with both SNA and
   UXA capabilities.

   To work around this problem, as well as enabling support for UXA, it is
   necessary to force UXA to be used by creating a configuration file. If
   this problem applies to you, create the following file as the root user
   and modify it as needed:

 cat >> /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/20-intel.conf << "EOF"
 Section   "Device"
         Identifier "Intel Graphics"
         Driver     "intel"

  libvdpau-1.2

    Introduction to libvdpau

   The libvdpau package contains a library which implements the VDPAU
   library.

   VDPAU (Video Decode and Presentation API for Unix) is an open source
   library (libvdpau) and API originally designed by Nvidia for its GeForce 8
   series and later GPU hardware targeted at the X Window System This VDPAU
   API allows video programs to offload portions of the video decoding
   process and video post-processing to the GPU video-hardware.

   Currently, the portions capable of being offloaded by VDPAU onto the GPU
   are motion compensation (mo comp), inverse discrete cosine transform
   (iDCT), VLD (variable-length decoding) and deblocking for MPEG-1, MPEG-2,
   MPEG-4 ASP (MPEG-4 Part 2), H.264/MPEG-4 AVC and VC-1, WMV3/WMV9 encoded
   videos. Which specific codecs of these that can be offloaded to the GPU
   depends on the version of the GPU hardware; specifically, to also decode
   MPEG-4 ASP (MPEG-4 Part 2), Xvid/OpenDivX (DivX 4), and DivX 5 formats, a
   GeForce 200M (2xxM) Series (the eleventh generation of Nvidia's GeForce
   graphics processing units) or newer GPU hardware is required.

   Now, as the root user:

 make install    &&
 make install-ti &&

 mkdir -pv /usr/share/applications &&
 cp -v *.desktop /usr/share/applications/

  Command Explanations

   sed -i ... termcap, printf ... >> terminfo: These commands modify the
   terminal description so that the Backspace key is expected to send the
   character with ASCII code 127. This is done for consistency with the Linux
   console.

   TERMINFO=/usr/share/terminfo: This ensures that the xterm terminfo files
   are installed to the system terminfo database.

   --with-app-defaults=...: Sets the location for the app-defaults directory.

   make install-ti: This command installs corrected terminfo description
   files for use with xterm.

  Configuring xterm

   There are two ways to configure xterm. You can add the X resource
   definitions to the user's ~/.Xresources file, or add them to the
   system-wide $XORG_PREFIX/share/X11/app-defaults/Xterm file.

   In order for xterm to follow the locale settings in the environment, use
   TrueType fonts, and follow the Linux convention about the code sent by the
   Backspace key, add the following definitions as the root user:

 cat >> /etc/X11/app-defaults/XTerm << "EOF"
 *VT100*locale: true
 *VT100*faceName: Monospace
 *VT100*faceSize: 10
 *backarrowKeyIsErase: true

   User Notes: http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/xinit

  Installation of xinit

   Install xinit by running the following commands:

 ./configure $XORG_CONFIG --with-xinitdir=/etc/X11/app-defaults &&
 make

   This package does not come with a test suite.

   Now, as the root user:

 make install &&
 ldconfig

  Note

   If starting Xorg from the command line, the default instructions above
   starts Xorg on the current virtual terminal. It may be convenient to see
   Xorg and associated application messages on the current virtual terminal,
   normally tty1, and start the graphical environment on the first available
   unused virtual terminal, normally tty7. To do this, set the suid bit on
   the Xorg application as the root user:

 chmod u+s $XORG_PREFIX/libexec/Xorg

   At this point you can start Xorg on virtual terminal 7 with startx <client
   arguments> -- vt7. Now you can toggle between tty1 and tty7 with the
   Ctrl-Alt-F1 and Ctrl-Alt-F7 key combinations.

   To automatically start Xorg on the first available virtual terminal,
   modify the startx script as the root user with:

 sed -e '/$serverargs $vtarg/ s/serverargs/: #&/' $XORG_PREFIX/bin/startx

   After this change, the virtual terminal does not need to be specified on
   the startx command line.

Xorg-7 Testing and Configuration

  Testing Xorg

  Note

   Before starting Xorg for the first time, is is useful to rebuild the
   library cache by running ldconfig as the root user.

  Note

   Before starting Xorg for the first time, is is often needed to reboot the
   system to ensure all appropriate daemons are started and approprite
   security issues are properly set. As an alternative, logging out and
   logging back in may work, but as of this writing has not been tested.

   To test the Xorg installation, issue startx. This command brings up a
   rudimentary window manager called twm with three xterm windows and one
   xclock window. The xterm window in the upper left is a login terminal and
   running exit from this terminal will exit the X Window session. The third
   xterm window may be obscured on your system by the other two xterms.

  Note

   When testing Xorg with the twm window manager, there will be several
   warnings in the Xorg log file, $HOME/.local/share/xorg/Xorg.0.log, about
   missing font files. In addition, there will be several warnings on the
   text mode terminal (usually tty1) about missing fonts. These warnings do
   not affect functionality, but can be removed if desired by installing the
   Xorg Legacy Fonts.

   Generally, there is no specific configuration required for Xorg, but
   customization is possible. For details, see the section called âSetting up
   Xorg Devicesâ below.

  Checking the Direct Rendering Infrastructure (DRI) Installation

   DRI is a framework for allowing software to access graphics hardware in a
   safe and efficient manner. It is installed in X by default (using Mesa) if
   you have a supported video card.

   To check if DRI drivers are installed properly, check the log file
   /var/log/Xorg.0.log for statements such as:

 (II) intel(0): direct rendering: DRI2 Enabled

   or

 (II) NOUVEAU(0): Loaded DRI module

  Note

   DRI configuration may differ if you are using alternate drivers, such as
   those from NVIDIA or AMD.

   Another way to determine if DRI is working properly is to use one of the
   two optionally installed OpenGL demo programs in Mesa-19.1.4. From an X
   terminal, run glxinfo and look for the phrase:

 name of display: :0
 display: :0  screen: 0
 direct rendering: Yes

   If direct rendering is enabled, you can add verbosity by running
   LIBGL_DEBUG=verbose glxinfo. This will show the drivers, device nodes and
   files used by the DRI system.

   To confirm that DRI2 hardware acceleration is working, you can (still in
   the X terminal) run the command glxinfo | egrep "(OpenGL vendor|OpenGL
   renderer|OpenGL version)". If that reports something other than Software
   Rasterizer then you have working acceleration for the user who ran the
   command.

   If your hardware does not have any DRI2 driver available, it will use a
   Software Rasterizer for Direct Rendering. In such cases, you can use a
   new, LLVM-accelerated, Software Rasterizer called LLVMPipe. In order to
   build LLVMPipe just make sure that LLVM-8.0.1 is present at Mesa build
   time. Note that all decoding is done on the CPU instead of the GPU, so the
   display will run slower than with hardware acceleration. To check if you
   are using LLVMpipe, review the output of the glxinfo command above. An
   example of the output using the Software Rasterizer is shown below:

 OpenGL vendor string: VMware, Inc.
 OpenGL renderer string: Gallium 0.4 on llvmpipe (LLVM 3.5, 256 bits)
 OpenGL version string: 3.0 Mesa 10.4.5

   You can also force LLVMPipe by exporting the LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=1
   environment variable when starting Xorg.

   Again, if you have built the Mesa OpenGL demos, you can also run the test
   program glxgears. This program brings up a window with three gears
   turning. The X terminal will display how many frames were drawn every five
   seconds, so this will give a rough benchmark. The window is scalable, and
   the frames drawn per second is highly dependent on the size of the window.
   On some hardware, glxgears will run synchronized with the vertical refresh
   signal and the frame rate will be approximately the same as the monitor
   refresh rate.

  Hybrid Graphics

   Hybrid Graphics is still in experimental state for Linux. Xorg Developers
   have developed a technology called PRIME that can be used for switching
   between integrated and muxless discrete GPU at will. Automatic switching
   is not possible at the moment.

   In order to use PRIME for GPU switching, make sure that you are using
   Linux Kernel 3.4 or later (recommended). You will need latest DRI and DDX
   drivers for your hardware and Xorg Server 1.13 or later.

   Xorg Server should load both GPU drivers automaticaly. You can check that
   by running:

 xrandr --listproviders

   There should be two (or more) providers listed, for example:

 Providers: number : 2
 Provider 0: id: 0x7d cap: 0xb, Source Output, Sink Output, Sink Offload crtcs: 3 outputs: 4 associated providers: 1 name:Intel
 Provider 1: id: 0x56 cap: 0xf, Source Output, Sink Output, Source Offload, Sink Offload crtcs: 6 outputs: 1 associated providers: 1 name:radeon

   In order to be able to run a GLX application on a discrete GPU, you will
   need to run the following command, where <provider> is the more powerful
   discrete card, and <sink> is the card which has a display connected:

 xrandr --setprovideroffloadsink <provider> <sink>

  Note

   With newer Xorg drivers, such as modesetting or intel, which are DRI3
   capable, the above command is no longer necessary. It does no harm
   however.

   Then, you will need to export the DRI_PRIME=1 environment variable each
   time you want the powerful GPU to be used. For example,

 DRI_PRIME=1 glxinfo | egrep "(OpenGL vendor|OpenGL renderer|OpenGL version)"

   will show OpenGL vendor, renderer and version for the discrete GPU.

   If the last command reports same OpenGL renderer with and without
   DRI_PRIME=1, you will need to check your installation.

  Setting up Xorg Devices

   For most hardware configurations, modern Xorg will automatically get the
   server configuration correct without any user intervention. There are,
   however, some cases where auto-configuration will be incorrect. Following
   are some example manual configuration items that may be of use in these
   instances.

    Setting up X Input Devices

   For most input devices, no additional configuration will be necessary.
   This section is provided for informational purposes only.

   A sample default XKB setup could look like the following (executed as the
   root user):

 cat > /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/xkb-defaults.conf << "EOF"
 Section "InputClass"
     Identifier "XKB Defaults"
     MatchIsKeyboard "yes"
     Option "XkbLayout" "fr"
     Option "XkbOptions" "terminate:ctrl_alt_bksp"
 EndSection
 EOF

   The âXkbLayoutâ line is an example for a French (AZERTY) keyboard. Change
   it to your keyboard model. That line is not needed for a QWERTY (US)
   keyboard.

    Fine Tuning Display Settings

   Again, with modern Xorg, little or no additional configuration is
   necessary. If you should need extra options passed to your video driver,
   for instance, you could use something like the following (again, executed
   as the root user):

 cat > /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/videocard-0.conf << "EOF"
 Section "Device"
     Identifier  "Videocard0"
     Driver      "radeon"
     VendorName  "Videocard vendor"
     BoardName   "ATI Radeon 7500"
     Option      "NoAccel" "true"
 EndSection
 EOF

   Another common setup is having multiple server layouts for use in
   different environments. Though the server will automatically detect the
   presence of another monitor, it may get the order incorrect:

 cat > /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/server-layout.conf << "EOF"
 Section "ServerLayout"
     Identifier     "DefaultLayout"
     Screen      0  "Screen0" 0 0
     Screen      1  "Screen1" LeftOf "Screen0"
     Option         "Xinerama"
 EndSection
 EOF

Tuning Fontconfig

  Overview of Fontconfig

   If you only read text in English, and are happy with the common libre
   fonts listed on the next page, you may never need to worry about the
   details of how fontconfig works. But there are many things which can be
   altered if they do not suit your needs.

   Although this page is long, it barely scratches the surface and you will
   be able to find many alternative views on the web (but please remember
   that some things have changed over the years, for example the autohinter
   is no longer the default). The aim here is to give you enough information
   to understand the changes you are making.

   User Notes: http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/Fontconfig

  The Xft Font Protocol

   The Xft font protocol provides antialiased font rendering through
   freetype, and fonts are controlled from the client side using fontconfig
   (except for rxvt-unicode-9.22 which can use fonts listed in ~/.Xresources,
   and AbiWord-3.0.2 which only uses the specified font). The default search
   path is /usr/share/fonts and ~/.local/share/fonts although for the moment
   the old and deprecated location ~/.fonts still works. Fontconfig searches
   directories in its path recursively and maintains a cache of the font
   characteristics in each directory. If the cache appears to be out of date,
   it is ignored, and information is fetched from the fonts themselves (that
   can take a few seconds if you installed a lot of fonts).

   If you've installed Xorg in any prefix other than /usr, any X fonts were
   not installed in a location known to Fontconfig. Symlinks were created
   from the OTF and TTF X font directories to /usr/share/fonts/X11-{OTF,TTF}.
   This allows Fontconfig to use the OpenType and TrueType fonts provided by
   X, although many people will prefer to use more modern fonts.

   Fontconfig uses names to define fonts. Applications generally use generic
   font names such as "Monospace", "Sans" and "Serif". Fontconfig resolves
   these names to a font that has all characters that cover the orthography
   of the language indicated by the locale settings.

  Useful Commands

   The following commands may be helpful when working with fontconfig:

   fc-list | less : show a list of all available fonts (/path/to/filename:
   Font Name:style). If you installed a font more than 30 seconds ago but it
   does not show, then it or one of its directories is not readable by your
   user.

   fc-match 'Font Name' : will tell you which font will be used if the named
   font is requested. Typically you would use this to see what happens if a
   font you have not installed is requested, but you can also use it if the
   system is giving you a different font from what you expected (perhaps
   because fontconfig does not agree that the font supports your language).

   fc-match -a 'Type' | less : will provide a list of all fonts which can be
   used for that type (Monospace, Sans, Serif). Note that in-extremis
   fontconfig will take a glyph from any available font, even if it is not of
   the specified type, and unless it knows about the font's type it will
   assume it is Sans.

   If you wish to know which font will be used for a string of text (i.e. one
   or more glyphs, preceded by a space), paste the following command and
   replace the xyz by the text you care about:

   FC_DEBUG=4 pango-view --font=monospace -t xyz | grep family : this
   requires Pango-1.42.4 and ImageMagick-7.0.8-60 - it will invoke display to
   show the text in a tiny window, and after closing that the last line of
   the output will show which font was chosen. This is particularly useful
   for CJK languages, and you can also pass a language, e.g.
   PANGO_LANGUAGE=en;ja (English, then assume Japanese) or just zh-cn (or
   other variants - 'zh' on its own is not valid).

  The various files

   The main files are in /etc/fonts/conf.d/, which was intended to be a
   directory populated by symlinks to some of the files in
   /usr/share/fontconfig/conf.avail/. But many people, and some packages,
   create the files directly. Each file name must be in the form of two
   digits, a dash, somename.conf and they are read in sequence.

   By convention, the numbers are assigned as follows:

     * 00-09 extra font directories

     * 10-19 system rendering defaults (antialising etc)

     * 20-29 font rendering options

     * 30-39 family substitution

     * 40-49 map family to generic type

     * 50-59 load alternate config files

     * 60-69 generic aliases, map generic to family

     * 70-79 adjust which fonts are available

     * 80-89 match target scan (modify scanned patterns)

     * 90-99 font synthesis

   You can also have a personal fonts.conf in $XDG_CONFIG_HOME which is
   ~/.config/fontconfig/.

  The rules to choose a font

   If the requested font is installed, and provided it contains the
   codepoints required for the current language (in the source, see the .orth
   files in the fc-lang/ directory), it will be used.

   But if the document or page requested a font which is not installed (or,
   occasionally, does not contain all the required codepoints) the following
   rules come into play: First, 30-metric-aliases.conf is used to map aliases
   for some fonts with the same metrics (same size, etc). After that, an
   unknown font will be searched for in 45-latin.conf - if it is found it
   will be mapped as Serif or Monospace or Sans, otherwise it will be assumed
   to be Sans. Then 50-latin.conf provides ordered lists of the fallbacks -
   Dejavu fonts will be used if you installed them. Cyrillic and Greek appear
   to be treated in the same way. There are similar files with a 65- prefix
   for Persian and other non-latin writing systems. All of these files prefer
   commercial fonts if they are present, although modern libre fonts are
   often at least their equals.

   Since fontconfig-2.12.5 there is also generic family matching for some
   emoji and math fonts, see {45,60}-generic.conf.

   In the rare cases where a font does not contain all the expected
   codepoints, see 'Trial the First:' at I stared into the fontconfig for the
   long details.

  Hinting and Anti-aliasing

   It is possible to change how, or if, fonts are hinted. The following
   example file contains the default settings, but with comments. The
   settings are very much down to the user's preferences and to the choice of
   fonts, so a change which improves some pages may worsen others. The
   preferred location for this file is: ~/.config/fontconfig/fonts.conf

   To try out different settings, you may need to exit from Xorg and then
   rerun startx so that all applications use the new settings. And if you use
   Gnome or KDE their desktops can override these changes. To explore the
   possibilities, create a file for your user:

 mkdir -pv ~/.config/fontconfig &&
 cat > ~/.config/fontconfig/fonts.conf << "EOF"
 <?xml version='1.0'?>
 <!DOCTYPE fontconfig SYSTEM 'fonts.dtd'>
 <fontconfig>

   <match target="font" >
     <!-- autohint was the old automatic hinter when hinting was patent
     protected, so turn it off to ensure any hinting information in the font
     itself is used, this is the default -->
     <edit mode="assign" name="autohint">  <bool>false</bool></edit>

     <!-- hinting is enabled by default -->
     <edit mode="assign" name="hinting">   <bool>true</bool></edit>

     hintslight is the default: - supposed to be more fuzzy but retains shape.
    
     hintnone: seems to turn hinting off.

   You will now need to edit the file in your preferred editor.

  Disabling Bitmap Fonts

   In previous versions of BLFS, the ugly old Xorg bitmap fonts were
   installed. Now, many people will not need to install any of them. But if
   for some reason you have installed one or more bitmap fonts, you can
   prevent them being used by fontconfig by creating the following file as
   the root user :

 cat > /etc/fonts/conf.d/70-no-bitmaps.conf << "EOF"
 <?xml version='1.0'?>
 <!DOCTYPE fontconfig SYSTEM 'fonts.dtd'>
 <fontconfig>
 <!-- Reject bitmap fonts -->
  <selectfont>
   <rejectfont>
    <pattern>
      <patelt name="scalable"><bool>false</bool></patelt>
    </pattern>
   </rejectfont>
  </selectfont>
 </fontconfig>
 EOF

  Adding extra font directories

   Normally, system fonts and user fonts are installed in directories beneath
   the locations specified in The Xft Font Protocol and there is no obvious
   reason to put them elsewhere. However, a full BLFS install of
   texlive-20190410 puts many fonts in /opt/texlive/2019/texmf-dist/fonts/ in
   the opentype/ and truetype/ subdirectories. Although pulling in all of
   these files may appear useful (it allows you to use them in non TeX
   programs), there are several problems with such an approach:

    1. There are hundreds of files, which makes selecting the font hard.

    2. Some of the files do odd things, such as displaying semaphore flags
       instead of ASCII letters, or mapping cyrillic codepoints to character
       forms appropriate to Old Church Slavonic instead of the expected
       current shapes: fine if that is what you need, but painful for normal
       use.

    3. Several fonts have multiple sizes and impenetrable short names, which
       both make selecting the correct font even harder.

    4. When a font is added to CTAN, it is accompanied by TeX packages to use
       it in the old engines (xelatex does not normally need this), and then
       the version is often frozen whilst the font is separately maintained.
       Some of these fonts such as Dejavu fonts are probably already
       installed on your BLFS system in a newer version, and if you have
       multiple versions of a font it is unclear which one will be used by
       fontconfig.

   However, it is sometimes useful to look at these fonts in non-TeX
   applications, if only to see whether you wish to install a current
   version. If you have installed all of texlive, the following example will
   make one of the Arkandis Open Type fonts available to other applications,
   and all three of the ParaType TrueType fonts. Adjust or repeat the lines
   as desired, to either make all the opentype/ or truetypefonts available,
   or to select different font directories. As the root user:

 cat > /etc/fonts/conf.d/09-texlive.conf << "EOF"
 <?xml version='1.0'?>
 <!DOCTYPE fontconfig SYSTEM 'fonts.dtd'>
 <fontconfig>
   <dir>/opt/texlive/2019/texmf-dist/fonts/opentype/arkandis/berenisadf</dir>
   <dir>/opt/texlive/2019/texmf-dist/fonts/truetype/paratype</dir>
 </fontconfig>
 EOF

   If you do this, remember to change all instances of the year in that file
   when you upgrade texlive to a later release.

  Preferring certain fonts

   There are many reasons why people may wish to have pages which specify a
   particular font use a different font, or prefer specific fonts in
   Monospace or Sans or Serif. As you will expect, there a number of
   different ways of achieving this.

    Fontconfig user docs

   Fontconfig installs user documentation that includes an example 'User
   configuration file' which among other things prefers WenQuanYi ZenHei (a
   Sans font) if a Serif font is requested for Chinese (this part might be
   anachronistic unless you have non-free Chinese fonts, because in
   65-nonlatin.conf this font is already among the preferred fonts when Serif
   is specified for Chinese) and to prefer the modern VL Gothic font if a
   Sans font is specified on a Japanese page (otherwise a couple of other
   fonts would be preferred if they have been installed).

   If you have installed the current version, the user documentation is
   available in html, PDF and text versions at
   /usr/share/doc/fontconfig-2.13.1/ : change the version if you installed a
   different one.

    Prefer a specific font

   As an example, if for some reason you wished to use the Nimbus Roman No9 L
   font wherever Times New Roman is referenced (it is metrically similar, and
   preferred for Times Roman, but the Serif font from Liberation fonts will
   be preferred for the Times New Roman font if installed), as an individual
   user you could install the font and then create the following file:

 mkdir -pv ~/.config/fontconfig/conf.d &&
 cat >  ~/.config/fontconfig/conf.d/35-prefer-nimbus-for-timesnew.conf << "EOF"
 <?xml version='1.0'?>
 <!DOCTYPE fontconfig SYSTEM 'fonts.dtd'>
 <fontconfig>
 <!-- prefer Nimbus Roman No9 L for Times New Roman as well as for Times,
  without this Tinos and Liberation Serif take precedence for Times New Roman
  before fontconfig falls back to whatever matches Times -->
     <alias binding="same">
         <family>Times New Roman</family>
         <accept>
             <family>Nimbus Roman No9 L</family>
         </accept>
     </alias>
 </fontconfig>
 EOF

   This is something you would normally do in an individual user's settings,
   but the file in this case has been prefixed '35-' so that it could, if
   desired, be used system-wide in /etc/fonts/conf.d/.

    Prefer chosen CJK fonts

   The following example of a local configuration (i.e. one that applies for
   all users of the machine) does several things:

    1. If a Serif font is specified, it will prefer the UMing variants, so
       that in the zh-cn, zh-hk and zh-tw languages things should look good
       (also zh-sg which actually uses the same settings as zh-cn) without
       affecting Japanese.

    2. It prefers the Japanese IPAex fonts if they have been installed
       (although VL Gothic will take precedence for (Japanese) Sans if it has
       also been installed.

    3. Because WenQuanYi ZenHei covers Korean Hangul glyphs and is also
       preferred for Serif in 65-nonlatin.conf, if installed it will be used
       by default for Korean Serif. To get a proper Serif font, the UnBatang
       font is specified here - change that line if you installed a different
       Serif font from the choice of Korean fonts.

    4. The Monospace fonts are forced to the preferred Sans fonts. If the
       text is in Korean then WenQuanYi ZenHei will be used.

   In a non-CJK locale, the result is that suitable fonts will be used for
   all variants of Chinese, Japanese and Hangul Korean. All other languages
   should already work if a font is present. As the root user:

 cat > /etc/fonts/local.conf << "EOF"
 <?xml version='1.0'?>
 <!DOCTYPE fontconfig SYSTEM 'fonts.dtd'>
 <fontconfig>
     <alias>
         <family>serif</family>
         <prefer>
             <family>AR PL UMing</family>
             <family>IPAexMincho</family>
             <!-- WenQuanYi is preferred as Serif in 65-nonlatin.conf,
             override that so a real Korean font can be used for Serif -->
             <family>UnBatang</family>
         </prefer>
     </alias>
     <alias>
          <family>sans-serif</family>
          <prefer>
              <family>WenQuanYi Zen Hei</family>
              <family>VL Gothic</family>
              <family>IPAexGothic</family>
          </prefer>
     </alias>
     <alias>
          <family>monospace</family>
          <prefer>
              <family>VL Gothic</family>
              <family>IPAexGothic</family>
              <family>WenQuanYi Zen Hei</family>
          </prefer>
     </alias>
 </fontconfig>
 EOF

  Editing Old-style conf files

   Some fonts, particularly Chinese fonts, ship with conf files which can be
   installed in /etc/fonts/conf.d. However, if you do that and then use a
   terminal to run any command which uses fontconfig you may see error
   messages such as :

   Fontconfig warning: "/etc/fonts/conf.d/69-odofonts.conf", line 14: Having
   multiple <family> in <alias> isn't supported and may not work as expected.

   In practice, these old rules do not work. For non-CJK users, fontconfig
   will usually do a good job without these rules. Their origin dates back to
   when CJK users needed handcrafted bitmaps to be legible at small sizes,
   and those looked ugly next to antialiased Latin glyphs - they preferred to
   use the same CJK font for the Latin glyphs. There is a side-effect of
   doing this : the (Serif) font is often also used for Sans, and in such a
   situation the (English) text in Gtk menus will use this font - compared to
   system fonts, as well as being serif it is both faint and rather small.
   That can make it uncomfortable to read.

   Nevertheless, these old conf files can be fixed if you wish to use them.
   The following example is the first part of 64-arphic-uming.conf from UMing
   - there are a lot more similar items which also need changing :

      <match target="pattern">
          <test qual="any" name="lang" compare="contains">
              <string>zh-cn</string>
              <string>zh-sg</string>
          </test>
          <test qual="any" name="family">
              <string>serif</string>
          </test>
          <edit name="family" mode="prepend" binding="strong">
              <string>AR PL UMing CN</string>
          </edit>
       </match>

   The process to correct this is straightforward but tedious - for every
   item which produces an error message, using your editor (as the root user)
   edit the installed file to repeat the whole block as many times as there
   are multiple variables, then reduce each example to have only one of them.
   You may wish to work on one error at a time, save the file after each fix,
   and from a separate term run a command such as fc-list 2>&1 | less to see
   that the fix worked. For the block above, the fixed version will be :

      <match target="pattern">
          <test qual="any" name="lang" compare="contains">
              <string>zh-cn</string>
          </test>
          <test qual="any" name="family">
              <string>serif</string>
          </test>
          <edit name="family" mode="prepend" binding="strong">
              <string>AR PL UMing CN</string>
          </edit>
       </match>
      <match target="pattern">
          <test qual="any" name="lang" compare="contains">
              <string>zh-sg</string>
          </test>
          <test qual="any" name="family">
              <string>serif</string>
          </test>
          <edit name="family" mode="prepend" binding="strong">
              <string>AR PL UMing CN</string>
          </edit>
       </match>

TTF and OTF fonts

  About TTF and OTF fonts

   Originally, Xorg provided only bitmap fonts. Later, some scalable Type1
   fonts were added, but the desktop world moved on to using TrueType and
   Open Type fonts. To support these, Xorg uses Xft, the X FreeType interface
   library.

   These fonts can provide hints, which fontconfig uses to adjust them for
   maximum readability on computer monitors. On linux you should always
   prefer the hinted versions, if available (in general the latin, cyrillic
   and greek alphabets can use hints, most other writing systems do not use
   hinting).

   A few fonts are provided as collections (TTC or OTC) where font data is
   shared between different fonts, thus saving disk space. Treat these in
   exactly the same way as individual TTF or OTF files.

   If a font provides both TTF and OTF forms, prefer the OTF form in linux,
   it may provide more features for programs which know how to use them (such
   as xelatex).

   For some scripts pango is required to render things correctly, either by
   selecting different glyph forms, or by combining glyphs - in both cases,
   according to the context. This applies particularly to arabic and indic
   scripts.

   Standard scalable fonts that come with X provide very poor Unicode
   coverage. You may notice in applications that use Xft that some characters
   appear as a box with four binary digits inside. In this case, a font with
   the required glyphs has not been found. Other times, applications that
   don't use other font families by default and don't accept substitutions
   from Fontconfig will display blank lines when the default font doesn't
   cover the orthography of the user's language.

   The fonts available to a program are those which were present when it was
   started, so if you add an extra font and wish to use it in a program which
   is currently running, then you will have to close and restart that
   program.

   Some people are happy to have dozens, or even hundreds, of font files
   available, but if you ever wish to select a specific font in a desktop
   application (for example in a word processor) then scrolling through a lot
   of fonts to find the right one is slow and awkward - fewer is better. So,
   for some font packages you might decide to install only one of the fonts -
   but nevertheless install the different variants (italic, bold, etc) as
   these are all variations for the same font name.

   In the past, everybody recommended running fc-cache as the root user after
   installing or removing fonts, but this is no-longer necessary on linux,
   fontconfig will do it automatically if needed and if its caches are more
   than 30 seconds old. But if you add a font and want to immediately use it
   then you can run that command (as a normal user).

   There are several references below to CJK characters. This stands for
   Chinese, Japanese and Korean, although modern Korean is now almost all
   written using the phonetic Hangul glyphs (it used to sometimes use Hanja
   glyphs which are similar to Chinese and Japanese). Unicode decided to go
   for Han Unification and to map some Chinese and Japanese glyphs to the
   same codepoints. This was very unpopular in Japan, and the result is that
   different fonts will render some codepoints in quite different shapes. In
   addition, Simplified Chinese will sometimes use the same codepoint as
   Traditional Chinese but will show it differently, somewhat analogous to
   the different shapes used for the letters 'a' and 'g' in English
   (single-storey and two-storey), except that in a language context one will
   look "wrong" rather than just "different".

   Unlike most other packages in this book, the BLFS editors do not monitor
   the versions of the fonts on this page - once a font is good enough for
   general use, the typical additions in a new version are minor (e.g. new
   currency symbols, or glyphs not for a modern language, such as emojis or
   playing cards). Therefore, none of these fonts show version or md5
   information.

   The list below will not provide complete Unicode coverage. Unicode is
   updated every year, and most additions are now for historic writing
   systems. For almost-complete coverage you can install Noto fonts (about
   180 fonts when last checked) but that number of fonts makes it much less
   convenient to select a specific font in a document, and most people will
   regard many of them as a waste of space. We used to recommend the Unicode
   Font Guide, but that has not been updated since 2008 and many of its links
   are dead.

   Rendered examples of most of these fonts, and many others, with details of
   what languages they cover, some examples of latin fonts with the same
   metrics (listed as "Substitute latin fonts") and various files of dummy
   text to compare fonts of similar types, can be found at this font
   comparison page. That site also covers other current writing systems.

   Fonts are often supplied in zip files, requiring UnZip-6.0 to list and
   extract them, but even if the current release is a tarball you should
   still check to see if it will create a directory (scatterring the contents
   of a zipfile or tarball across the current directory can be very messy,
   and a few fonts create odd __MACOSX/ directories. In addition, many fonts
   are supplied with permissions which do not let 'other' read them - if a
   font is to be installed for system-wide use, any directories must be mode
   755 and all the files mode 644, so change them if necessary. If you
   forget, the root user may be able to see a particular font in fc-list but
   a normal user will not.

   As a font installation example, consider the installation of the Dejavu
   fonts. In this particular package, the TTF files are in a subdirectory.
   From the unpacked source directory, run the following commands as the root
   user:

 install -v -d -m755 /usr/share/fonts/dejavu &&
 install -v -m644 ttf/*.ttf /usr/share/fonts/dejavu &&
 fc-cache -v /usr/share/fonts/dejavu

   If you wish, you can also install any licenses or other documentation,
   either alongside the font or in a corresponding directory under
   /usr/share/doc/.

   A few fonts ship with source as well as with the completed TTF or OTF
   file(s). Unless you intend to modify the font, and have the correct tools
   (sometimes FontForge-20170731, but often commercial tools), the source
   will provide no benefit, so do not install it. One or two fonts even ship
   with Web Open Font Format (WOFF) files - useful if you run a webserver and
   want to use that font on it, but not useful for desktops.

   To provide greater Unicode coverage, you are recommended to install some
   of the following fonts, depending on what webistes and languages you wish
   to read. The next part of this page details some fonts which cover at
   least latin alphabets, the final part deals with come CJK issues.

  Note

   You are strongly recommended to install the Dejavu fonts.

    Caladea

   Caladea (created as a Chrome OS extra font, hence the 'crosextrafonts'
   tarball name) is metrically compatible with MS Cambria and can be used if
   you have to edit a document which somebody started in Microsoft Office
   using Cambria and then return it to them.

    Cantarell fonts

   Cantarell fonts - The Cantarell typeface family provides a contemporary
   Humanist sans serif. It is particularly optimised for legibility at small
   sizes and is the preferred font family for the GNOME-3 user interface.

    Carlito

   Carlito (created as another Chrome OS extra font, again the
   'crosextrafonts-' prefix in the tarball name) is metrically compatible
   with MS Calibri and can be used if you have to edit a document which
   somebody started in Microsoft Office using Calibri and then return it to
   them.

    DejaVu fonts

   DejaVu fonts - These fonts are an extension of, and replacement for, the
   Bitstream Vera fonts and provide Latin-based scripts with accents and
   punctuation such as "smart-quotes" and variant spacing characters, as well
   as Cyrillic, Greek, Arabic, Hebrew, Armenian, Georgian and some other
   glyphs. In the absence of the Bitstream Vera fonts (which had much less
   coverage), these are the default fallback fonts.

    GNU FreeFont

   GNU FreeFont - This set of fonts covers many non-CJK characters, in
   particular some of the variants of latin and cyrillic letters used in
   minority languages, but the glyphs are comparatively small (unlike DejaVu
   fonts which are comparatively large) and rather light weight ("less black"
   when black on white is used) which means that in some contexts such as
   terminals they are not visually pleasing, for example when most other
   glyphs are provided by another font. On the other hand, some fonts used
   primarily for printed output, and many CJK fonts, are also light weight.

    Gelasio

   Gelasio is metrically compatible with MS Georgia and fontconfig will use
   it if ever Georgia is requested but not installed.

    Liberation fonts

   The Liberation fonts provide libre substitutes for Arial, Courier New, and
   Times New Roman. Fontconfig will use them as substitutes for those fonts,
   and also for the similar Helvetica, Courier, Times Roman although for
   these latter it can prefer a different font (see the examples in the
   'Substitutes' PDFs at zarniwhoop.uk).

   Many people will find the Liberation fonts useful for pages where one of
   those fonts is requested.

    Microsoft Core Fonts

   The Microsoft Core fonts date from 2002. They were supplied with old
   versions of Microsoft Windows and were apparently made available for
   general use. You can extract them from the 'exe' files using bsd-tar from
   libarchive-3.4.0. Be sure to read the license before using them. At one
   time some of these fonts (particularly Arial, Times New Roman, and to a
   lesser extent Courier New) were widely specified on web pages. The full
   set contains Andale Mono, Arial, Arial Black, Comic Sans MS, Courier New,
   Georgia, Impact, Times New Roman, Trebuchet MS, Verdana and Webdings.

   Please note that if you only want to use a font with the same metrics
   (character size, etc) as Arial, Courier New, or Times New Roman you can
   use the libre Liberation Fonts (above), and similarly you can replace
   Georgia with Gelasio.

   Although many old posts recommend installing these fonts for
   better-looking output, there are more recent posts that these are ugly or
   'broken'. One suggestion is that they do not support anti-aliasing.

   The newer fonts which Microsoft made their defaults in later releases of
   MS Windows or MS Office (Calibri and Cambria) have never been freely
   available. But if you do not have them installed you can find metric
   equivalents (Carlito, Caladea) above.

    Noto fonts

   The Noto fonts ('No Tofu', i.e. avoiding boxes with dots [hex digits] when
   a glyph cannot be found) is a set of fonts which aim to cover every glyph
   in unicode, no matter how obscure. These fonts, or at least the Sans Serif
   fonts, are used by KF5 (initially only for gtk applications). If you want
   to cover historic languages, you can download all the fonts by clicking on
   the link at the top of that page.

   People using languages written in Latin, Greek or Cyrillic alphabets need
   only install Noto Sans itself, and perhaps Noto Sans Symbols for currency
   symbols. For more details on the CJK fonts see Noto Sans CJK below. There
   are also separate fonts for every other current writing system, but these
   too will also require Noto Sans (or Noto Serif) and perhaps Noto Symbols.

   However, you should be aware that fontconfig knows nothing about Noto
   fonts. The 'Noto Sans Something' fonts are each treated as separate fonts
   (and for Arabic there is not a specifically Sans name), so if you have
   other fonts installed then the choice of which font to use for missing
   glyphs where 'Noto Sans' is specified will be random, except that Sans
   fonts will be preferred over known Serif and Monospace fonts because Sans
   is the fallback for unknown fonts.

    Oxygen fonts

   When KDE Frameworks 5 was first released, it used the Oxygen fonts which
   were designed for integrated use with the KDE desktop. Those fonts are
   no-longer actively maintained, so KDE made a decision to switch to Noto
   fonts, but for the moment they are still required by 'startkde'.

   Originally these fonts were only supplied as source, needing CMake-3.15.2
   and FontForge-20170731 to create the TTF files. But for a while the source
   has also included the prepared TTF. The only unusual feature is that each
   TTF file is in its own subdirectory (oxygen-fonts/{*-?00}/) with the
   source in further subdirectories. You could just install the whole tarball
   if you prefer, although that will waste space.

    Source Code Pro

   This set of fonts from Adobe (seven different weights) includes what is
   now the preferred monospace font for those applications which use
   gsettings-desktop-schemas-3.32.0. The github release source-code-pro
   contains OTF (preferred) and TTF as well as the source and WOFF fonts.

   To use this in terminals, you probably only want the Regular font.

   There is also an older TTF version of this available from Google fonts but
   that has very limited coverage (adequate for most European languages using
   a latin alphabet).

    CJK fonts:

   As indicated earlier, usage of a combination of Chinese, Japanese and
   Korean can be tricky - each font only covers a subset of the available
   codepoints, the preferred shapes of the glyphs can differ between the
   languages, and many of the CJK fonts do not actually support modern
   Korean.

   Also, by default fontconfig prefers Chinese to Japanese. Tuning that is
   covered at Prefer chosen CJK fonts.

   Although Unicode has been extended to allow a very large number of CJK
   codepoints, those outside the Base Plane (greater than U+0xFFFF) are not
   commonly used in Mandarin (the normal form of written Chinese, whether
   Simplified (PRC) or Traditional (Taiwan)), or Japanese.

   For Hong Kong, which uses Traditional Chinese and where Cantonese is the
   dominant language, the Hong Kong Supplementary Character Set was added to
   Unicode in 2005 and revised in 2009 (it is part of CJK Extension B and
   contains more than 1900 characters). Earlier fonts will not be able to
   support either Cantonese or use of these characters where local names are
   written in Mandarin. The UMing HK, Noto Sans CJK HK and WenQuanYi Zen Hei
   fonts all seem to cover Hong Kong usage (fontconfig disagrees about Noto
   Sans CJK HK).

   The Han glyphs are double-width, other glyphs in the same font may be
   narrower. For their CJK content, all of these fonts can be regarded as
   monospaced (i.e. fixed width).

   If all you wish to do is to be able to render CJK glyphs, installing
   WenQuanYi ZenHei may be a good place to start if you do not already have a
   preference.

    Chinese fonts:

   In Chinese, there are three font styles in common use: Sung (also known as
   Song or Ming) which is the most-common ornamented ("serif") form, Kai
   ("brush strokes") which is an earlier ornamented style that looks quite
   different, and modern Hei ("sans"). Unless you appreciate the differences,
   you probably do not want to install Kai fonts.

      Noto Sans CJK

   Noto Sans CJK - Sans-Serif sets of all CJK fonts in a ttc - as the link
   says, you can choose to install the TTC and cover all the languages in all
   weights in a 110MB file, or you can download subsets. There are also
   Monospace versions.

      Opendesktop fonts

   A copy of version 1.4.2 of the opendesktop-fonts is preserved at Arch.
   This was a later development of fireflysung which BLFS used to recommend,
   adding Kai and Mono fonts. The name of the Sung font remains 'AR PL New
   Sung' so they cannot both be installed together.

   At one time there was a 1.6 release, and more recently some versions at
   github, which also included a Sans font (Odohei), but those have dropped
   off the web and it is unclear if there was a problem. Fontconfig does not
   know anything about the later fonts (AR PL New Kai, AR PL New Sung Mono)
   and will default to treating them as Sans.

      UMing

   UMing fonts - sets of Chinese Ming fonts (from Debian, use the '.orig'
   tarball) in a ttc which contain variations of Simplified and Traditional
   Chinese (Taiwanese, with second variant for different bopomofo, and
   Cantonese for Hong Kong). This ships with old-syntax files which you can
   install to /etc/fonts/conf.d/ but see Editing Old-Style conf files.

      WenQuanYi Zen Hei

   WenQuanYi Zen Hei provides a Sans-Serif font which covers all CJK scripts
   including Korean. Although it includes old-style conf files, these are not
   required: fontconfig will already treat these fonts (the 'sharp' contains
   bitmaps, the monospace appears not to be Mono in its ASCII part) as Sans,
   Serif, and Monospace. If all you wish to do is to be able to render Han
   and Korean text without worrying about the niceties of the shapes used,
   the main font from this package is a good font to use.

    Japanese fonts:

   In Japanese, Gothic fonts are Sans, Mincho are Serif. BLFS used to only
   mention the Kochi fonts, but those appear to now be the least-preferred of
   the Japanese fonts.

   Apart from the fonts detailed below, also consider Noto Sans CJK.

      IPAex fonts

   The IPAex fonts are the current version of the IPA fonts. Click on
   'English' at the link and then click on the Download icon to find IPAex
   Font Ver.003.01. Unfortunately, fontconfig only knows about the older
   IPAfonts and the forked IPA Mona font (which is not easily available and
   which apparently does not meet Debian's Free Software guidelines).
   Therefore if you install the IPAex fonts you may wish to make it known to
   fontconfig, see Prefer chosen CJK fonts for one possible way to do this.

      Kochi fonts

   The Kochi Substitute fonts were the first truly libre Japanese fonts (the
   earlier Kochi fonts were allegedly plagiarized from a commercial font).

      VL Gothic

   The VL Gothic font is a modern Japanese font in two variants with
   monotonic or proportional spacing for the non-Japanese characters.

    Korean fonts:

   In Korean, Batang or Myeongjo (the older name) are Serif, Dotum or Gothic
   are the main Sans fonts. BLFS previously recommended the Baekmuk fonts,
   but the Nanum and Un fonts are now preferred to Baekmuk by fontconfig
   because of user requests.

   A convenient place to see examples of these and many other Korean fonts is
   Free Korean Fonts. Click on 'Gothic Fonts' or 'All Categories -> Myeongjo
   Fonts', then click on the font example to see more details including the
   License, and click on the link to download it. For Nanum, you will need to
   be able to read Korean to find the download link on the page you get to.
   For Un there are direct links and you can find the un-fonts-core tarball
   in the releases/ directory.

   Alternatively, consider Noto Sans CJK (all of the variants cover Hangul)
   or WenQuanYi ZenHei.

Xorg Legacy

  Introduction to Xorg Legacy

   Xorg's ancestor (X11R1, in 1987) at first only provided bitmap fonts, with
   a tool (bdftopcf) to assist in their installation. With the introduction
   of xorg-server-1.19.0 and libXfont2 many people will not need them. There
   are still a few old packages which might require, or benefit from, these
   deprecated fonts and so the following packages are shown here.

  Note

   The font-adobe-100dpi package installs 100 dots per inch versions of
   Courier, Helvetica, New Century Schoolbook and Times fonts.

   The remaining font packages here provide 75dpi versions of those fonts,
   and various miscellaneous fonts - mostly for legacy encodings. Those are
   primarily to silence warnings when testing Xorg. In previous versions of
   BLFS a lot more legacy fonts were installed.

   Please consult the BLFS-7.10 book at
   http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/7.10/x/x7font.html if you wish
   to install any of those other fonts.

   This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS-9.0
   platform.

  Downloading Xorg Legacy

   First, create a list of files to be downloaded. This file will also be
   used to verify the integrity of the downloads when complete:

 cat > legacy.dat << "EOF"

 EOF

   To download the needed files using wget, use the following commands:

 mkdir legacy &&
 cd legacy &&
 grep -v '^#' ../legacy.dat | awk '{print $2$3}' | wget -i- -c \
      -B https://www.x.org/pub/individual/ &&
 grep -v '^#' ../legacy.dat | awk '{print $1 " " $3}' > ../legacy.md5 &&
 md5sum -c ../legacy.md5

  Installation of Xorg Legacy

  Note

   When installing multiple packages in a script, the installation needs to
   be done as the root user. There are three general options that can be used
   to do this:

    1. Run the entire script as the root user (not recommended).

    2. Use the sudo command from the Sudo-1.8.27 package.

    3. Use su -c "command arguments" (quotes required) which will ask for the
       root password for every iteration of the loop.

   One way to handle this situation is to create a short bash function that
   automatically selects the appropriate method. Once the command is set in
   the environment, it does not need to be set again.

 as_root()
 {
   if   [ $EUID = 0 ];        then $*
   elif [ -x /usr/bin/sudo ]; then sudo $*
   else                            su -c \\"$*\\"
   fi
 }

 export -f as_root

   First, start a subshell that will exit on error:

 bash -e

   Install all of the packages by running the following commands:

 for package in $(grep -v '^#' ../legacy.md5 | awk '{print $2}')
 do
   packagedir=${package%.tar.bz2}
   tar -xf $package
   pushd $packagedir
     ./configure $XORG_CONFIG
     make
     as_root make install
   popd
   rm -rf $packagedir
   as_root /sbin/ldconfig
 done

   Finally, exit the shell that was started earlier:

 exit

Chapter 25. X Libraries

   This chapter does not contain libraries that are required to run X. It
   does contain libraries that enhance X. In some cases the enhancement is as
   simple as font support. In others it is as complex as libraries that sit
   between X and applications that run on X whose purpose is to standardize
   the look and feel and inter-process communications for different
   applications. They also assist programmers by supplying common elements.

Cairo-1.16.0

  Introduction to Cairo

   Cairo is a 2D graphics library with support for multiple output devices.
   Currently supported output targets include the X Window System, win32,
   image buffers, PostScript, PDF and SVG. Experimental backends include
   OpenGL, Quartz and XCB file output. Cairo is designed to produce
   consistent output on all output media while taking advantage of display
   hardware acceleration when available (e.g., through the X Render
   Extension). The Cairo API provides operations similar to the drawing
   operators of PostScript and PDF. Operations in Cairo include stroking and
   filling cubic BÃ©zier splines, transforming and compositing translucent
   images, and antialiased text rendering. All drawing operations can be
   transformed by any affine transformation (scale, rotation, shear, etc.).

   This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS-9.0
   platform.

     * Estimated build time: 1.0 SBU (using parallelism=4; add 0.1 SBU for
       tests)

    GTK+ 2 Dependencies

      Required

   ATK-2.32.0, gdk-pixbuf-2.38.1 and Pango-1.42.4

      Recommended

   hicolor-icon-theme-0.17

      Optional

   Cups-2.2.12, DocBook-utils-0.6.14, gobject-introspection-1.60.2 and
   GTK-Doc-1.32

  Note

   If gobject-introspection-1.60.2 was installed after ATK-2.32.0,
   gdk-pixbuf-2.38.1, and/or Pango-1.42.4, those packages will have to be
   rebuilt before this package can be built.

   User Notes: http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/gtk+2

  Installation of GTK+ 2

   Install GTK+ 2 by running the following commands:

 sed -e 's#l \(gtk-.*\).sgml#& -o \1#' \
     -i docs/{faq,tutorial}/Makefile.in      &&

 ./configure --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc &&

 make

   To test the results, issue: make check. Note that you must run the tests
   from a session with X Window Display capability (i.e., not a text-based
   terminal/console) as the tests attempt to open an X window, and the tests
   can take an excessively long time. Using an X Window, the tests should
   take less than 0.3 SBU.

   Now, as the root user:

 make install

  Note

   If you installed the package on to your system using a âDESTDIRâ method,
   an important file was not installed and must be copied and/or generated.
   Generate it using the following command as the root user:

 gtk-query-immodules-2.0 --update-cache

  Command Explanations

   sed -i 's#l \(gtk-.*\).sgml#& -o \1#' docs/{faq,tutorial}/Makefile.in: If
   you have DocBook-utils-0.6.14 installed (specifically, if configure finds
   db2html) then it will try to use it to rebuild some of its HTML
   documentation and fail due to bugs in some of the Makefiles. This sed
   fixes the Makefiles.

   --enable-gtk-doc: Use this parameter if GTK-Doc is installed and you wish
   to rebuild and install the API documentation.

  Configuring GTK+ 2

    Config Files

   ~/.gtkrc-2.0, /etc/gtk-2.0/gtkrc, and /usr/share/gtk-2.0/gtkrc

    Configuration Information

   GTK+ 2 themes change the way a GTK+ 2 application looks. A GTK+ 2 icon
   theme can be used to change the icons that appear on the application's
   toolbar. If you have installed a GTK+ 2 theme (such as gnome-themes or GTK
   Engines-2.20.2), a GTK+ icon theme (such as adwaita-icon-theme-3.32.0) you
   can set your preferences in ~/.gtkrc-2.0:

 cat > ~/.gtkrc-2.0 << "EOF"
 include "/usr/share/themes/Glider/gtk-2.0/gtkrc"
 gtk-icon-theme-name = "hicolor"
 EOF

   There are many more themes available at Gnome-Look.org and other places.

   Once you've settled on themes you like, you can (as the root user) make
   them the default system wide:

 cat > /etc/gtk-2.0/gtkrc << "EOF"
 include "/usr/share/themes/Clearlooks/gtk-2.0/gtkrc"
 gtk-icon-theme-name = "elementary"
 EOF

   LXAppearance-0.6.3 is a GTK+ 2 application that can help you choose the
   themes you like.

   User Notes: http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/gtk3

  Installation of GTK+ 3

  Caution

   If you are upgrading from a version of GTK+3 prior to 3.24.9, you must run
   the remove-la-files.sh script from Libtool archive (.la) files after
   installing GTK+.

   Install GTK+ 3 by running the following commands:

 cd build &&
 meson --prefix=/usr     \
       -Dcolord=yes      \
       -Dgtk_doc=false   \
       -Dman=true        \
       -Dbroadway_backend=true .. &&
 ninja

   Some tests fail if /usr/share/glib-2.0/schemas/gschemas.compiled is not
   found. If you wish to run the test suite, create (or update) the file
   using the following command as the root user: glib-compile-schemas
   /usr/share/glib-2.0/schemas.

   To test the results you need a graphical session, then issue ninja test.
   six tests are known to fail in the a11y suite.

   Now, as the root user:

 ninja install

  Note

   If you installed the package on to your system using a âDESTDIRâ method,
   an important file was not installed and must be copied and/or generated.
   Generate it using the following command as the root user:

 gtk-query-immodules-3.0 --update-cache

  Note

   If you installed the package to your system using a âDESTDIRâ method,
   /usr/share/glib-2.0/schemas/gschemas.compiled was not updated/created.
   Create (or update) the file using the following command as the root user:

 glib-compile-schemas /usr/share/glib-2.0/schemas

  Command Explanations

   -Dbroadway_backend=true: This switch enables the HTML5 GTK backend.

   -Dcolord=yes: This switch allows color support in the GTK+ printing
   backend.

   -Dman=true: This switch allows generating manual pages.

   -Dgtk_doc=false: This switch disables building documentation. Replace with
   -Dgtk_doc=true if you have GTK-Doc-1.32 installed and wish to generate
   documentation.

  Configuring GTK+ 3

    Config Files

   ~/.config/gtk-3.0/settings.ini and /etc/gtk-3.0/settings.ini

    Configuration Information

   GTK+ 3 themes change the way a GTK+ 3 application looks. An icon theme can
   be used to change the icons that appear on the application's toolbar. If
   you have installed a GTK+ 3 theme (e.g. gnome-themes-extra-3.28), an icon
   theme (such as oxygen-icons5-5.61.0) and/or a font (Dejavu fonts), you can
   set your preferences in ~/.config/gtk-3.0/settings.ini, or the default
   system wide configuration file (as the root user), in
   /etc/gtk-3.0/settings.ini. For the local user an example is:

 mkdir -vp ~/.config/gtk-3.0
 cat > ~/.config/gtk-3.0/settings.ini << "EOF"
 [Settings]
 gtk-theme-name = Adwaita
 gtk-icon-theme-name = oxygen
 gtk-font-name = DejaVu Sans 12
 gtk-cursor-theme-size = 18
 gtk-toolbar-style = GTK_TOOLBAR_BOTH_HORIZ
 gtk-xft-antialias = 1
 gtk-xft-hinting = 1
 gtk-xft-hintstyle = hintslight
 gtk-xft-rgba = rgb
 gtk-cursor-theme-name = Adwaita
 EOF

   There are many settings keys, some with default values. You can find them
   at Settings: GTK+ 3 Reference Manual. There are many more themes available
   at http://gnome-look.org/ and other places.

    Short Descriptions

   broadwayd               provides support for displaying GTK+ 3             
                           applications in a web browser, using HTML5 and web 
                           sockets.                                           
   gtk3-demo               is a simple program that demonstrates some of the  
                           tasks that can be done with GTK+ 3                 
   gtk3-demo-application   is a simple GTK+ 3 application.                    
   gtk3-icon-browser       is a utility to explore the icons in the current   
                           icon theme. It shows icons in various sizes, their 
                           symbolic variants where available, as well as a    
                           description of the icon and its context.           
   gtk3-widget-factory     is a program to view GTK+ 3 themes and widgets.    
   gtk-builder-tool        can perform various operations on GtkBuilder .ui   
                           files.                                             
   gtk-encode-symbolic-svg converts symbolic svg icons into specially         
                           prepared png files. GTK+ 3 can load and recolor    
                           these pngs, just like original svgs, but loading   
                           them is much faster.                               
   gtk-launch              launches an application using the given name. The  
                           name should match the application desktop file     
                           name, as residing in /usr/share/applications, with 
                           or without the '.desktop' suffix.                  
   gtk-query-immodules-3.0 collects information about loadable input method   
                           modules for GTK+ 3 and writes it to the default    
                           cache file location, or to standard output.        
   gtk-query-settings      provides a complete listing of all settings        
                           related to GTK+ 3                                  
   gtk-update-icon-cache   is an icon theme caching utility that creates      
                           mmap()able cache files for icon themes.            
   libgailutil-3.so        contains functions that implement the              
                           accessibility interfaces defined by the GNOME      
                           Accessibility Toolkit.                             
   libgdk-3.so             contains functions that act as a wrapper around    
                           the low-level drawing and windowing functions      
                           provided by the underlying graphics system.        
   libgtk-3.so             contains functions that provide an API to

Qt-5.13.0

  Introduction to Qt5

   Qt5 is a cross-platform application framework that is widely used for
   developing application software with a graphical user interface (GUI) (in
   which cases Qt5 is classified as a widget toolkit), and also used for
   developing non-GUI programs such as command-line tools and consoles for
   servers. One of the major users of Qt is KDE Frameworks 5 (KF5).

   This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS-9.0
   platform.

   User Notes: http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/qt5

  Setting the installation prefix

    Installing in /opt/qt5

   The BLFS editors recommend installing Qt5 in a directory other than /usr,
   ie /opt/qt5. To do this, set the following environment variable:

 export QT5PREFIX=/opt/qt5

  Tip

   Sometimes, the installation paths are hardcoded into installed files. This
   is the reason why /opt/qt5 is used as installation prefix instead of
   /opt/qt-5.13.0. To create a versioned Qt5 directory, you may rename the
   directory and create a symlink:

 mkdir /opt/qt-5.13.0
 ln -sfnv qt-5.13.0 /opt/qt5

   Later on, you may want to install other versions of Qt5. To do that, just
   remove the symlink and use /opt/qt5 as the prefix again. Which version of
   Qt5 you use depends only on where the symlink points.

  Note

   If qca-2.2.1 has been installed and you are reinstalling or updating this
   package, then qca will need to be reinstalled.

  Installation of Qt5

  Warning

   If Qt5 is being reinstalled into the same directory as an existing
   instance, run the commands done by root, such as make install, from a
   console or non-Qt5 based window manager. It overwrites Qt5 libraries that
   should not be in use during the install process.

  Caution

   If you did not install some of the recommended dependencies, examine
   ./configure --help output to check how to disable them or use internal
   versions bundled in the source tarball.

  Note

   The build time and space required for the full Qt5 is quite long. The
   instructions below do not build the tutorials and examples. Removing the
   -nomake line will create a complete build.

  Note

   The BLFS editors do not recommend installing Qt5 into the /usr hierarchy
   because it becomes difficult to find components and to update to a new
   version. If you do want to install Qt5 in /usr, the directories need to be
   specified explicitly. In this case, set QT5PREFIX=/usr and add the
   following to the configure arguments below:

             -archdatadir    /usr/lib/qt5                \
             -bindir         /usr/bin                    \
             -plugindir      /usr/lib/qt5/plugins        \
             -importdir      /usr/lib/qt5/imports        \
             -headerdir      /usr/include/qt5            \
             -datadir        /usr/share/qt5              \
             -docdir         /usr/share/doc/qt5          \
             -translationdir /usr/share/qt5/translations \
             -examplesdir    /usr/share/doc/qt5/examples

   First fix some issues found upstream:

 patch -Np1 -i ../qt-5.13.0-upstream_fixes-1.patch &&

   Install Qt5 by running the following commands:

 sed -i 's/python /python3 /' qtdeclarative/qtdeclarative.pro \
                              qtdeclarative/src/3rdparty/masm/masm.pri &&

 ./configure -prefix $QT5PREFIX                        \
             -sysconfdir /etc/xdg                      \
             -confirm-license                          \
             -opensource                               \
             -dbus-linked                              \
             -openssl-linked                           \

             -system-sqlite                            \
             -nomake examples                          \
             -no-rpath                                 \
             -skip qtwebengine                         &&
 make

   This package does not come with a test suite.

   Now, as the root user:

 make install

   Remove references to the build directory from installed library dependency
   (prl) files by running the following command as the root user:

 find $QT5PREFIX/ -name \*.prl \
    -exec sed -i -e '/^QMAKE_PRL_BUILD_DIR/d' {} \;

   Install images and create the menu entries for installed applications. The
   QT5BINDIR variable is used here to point to the directory for the
   executable programs. If you have changed the bindir above, QT5BINDIR will
   need to be adjusted below. Be sure that the QT5BINDIR variable is defined
   in root's environment and as the root user:

 QT5BINDIR=$QT5PREFIX/bin

   Some packages such as VLC-3.0.8 look for certain executables with a -qt5
   suffix. Run the following command as the root user to create the necessary
   symlinks:

 for file in moc uic rcc qmake lconvert lrelease lupdate; do
   ln -sfrvn $QT5BINDIR/$file /usr/bin/$file-qt5
 done

  Command Explanations

   sed ...: Allows using Python 3 instead of Python 2. This command destroys
   the build for QtWebEngine, so do not use it if you remove the -skip
   qtwebengine switch.

   -confirm-license: Accept license without prompting user during
   configuration.

   -opensource: Install the opensource version of Qt.

   -nomake examples: This switch disables building of the example programs
   included in the source tarball. Remove it if you want to build them.

   -system-sqlite: This switch enables use of the system version of SQLite.

   -dbus-linked -openssl-linked: These switches enable explicit linking of
   the D-Bus and OpenSSL libraries into Qt5 libraries instead of dlopen()-ing
   them.

   -skip qtwebengine: This switch disables building the QtWebEngine. The BLFS
   editors have chosen to build qtwebengine-5.13.0 separately.

   -system-harfbuzz: This switch enables use of the system version of
   Harfbuzz.

  Configuring Qt5

    Configuration Information

   If you installed Qt5 in /usr, create an environment variable needed by
   certain packages. As the root user:

 cat > /etc/profile.d/qt5.sh << "EOF"
 # Begin /etc/profile.d/qt5.sh

 QT5DIR=/usr
 export QT5DIR
 pathappend $QT5DIR/bin

 # End /etc/profile.d/qt5.sh
 EOF

   If Sudo-1.8.27 is installed, QT5DIR should be available to the super user
   as well. Execute the following commands as the root user:

 cat > /etc/sudoers.d/qt << "EOF"
 Defaults env_keep += QT5DIR
 EOF

   If you installed Qt5 in a location other than /usr, you need to update the
   following configuration files so that Qt5 is correctly found by other
   packages and system processes.

   As the root user, update the /etc/ld.so.conf file and the dynamic linker's
   run-time cache file:

 cat >> /etc/ld.so.conf << EOF
 # Begin Qt addition

 /opt/qt5/lib

 # End Qt addition
 EOF

 ldconfig

   As the root user, create the /etc/profile.d/qt5.sh file:

 cat > /etc/profile.d/qt5.sh << "EOF"
 # Begin /etc/profile.d/qt5.sh

 QT5DIR=/opt/qt5

 pathappend $QT5DIR/bin           PATH
 pathappend $QT5DIR/lib/pkgconfig PKG_CONFIG_PATH

 export QT5DIR

 # End /etc/profile.d/qt5.sh
 EOF

QtWebEngine-5.13.0

  Introduction to QtWebEngine

   QtWebEngine integrates chromium's web capabilities into Qt. It ships with
   its own copy of ninja which it uses for the build if it cannot find a
   system copy, and various copies of libraries from ffmpeg, icu, libvpx, and
   zlib (including libminizip) which have been forked by the chromium
   developers.

   This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS-9.0
   platform.

  Note

   By default, ninja will use all online CPUs +2 (if at least 4 exist), even
   if they are not available to the current task because the build terminal
   has been restricted with 'taskset'. To work around this, see the Command
   Explanations below.

   Unusually, the shipped GN build system (used to create the Ninja files)
   requires a static libstdc++.a although the installed libraries correctly
   use the shared version. If that static library is not present, the build
   will fail quite quickly. Please note that if you try to build webengine as
   part of Qt and the static library is not available, that build will either
   complete without installing webengine, or else fail during the install
   (both variants have been observed in 5.12.0).

    qtwebengine Dependencies

      Required

   NSS-3.45, Python-2.7.16, and Qt-5.13.0

      Recommended

  Note

   If these packages are not installed, the build process will compile and
   install its own (perhaps older) version, with the side effect of
   increasing build and installed disk space and build time.

   either alsa-lib-1.1.9 or PulseAudio-12.2 (or both), FFmpeg-4.2, ICU-64.2,
   libwebp-1.0.3, libxslt-1.1.33, and Opus-1.3.1

      Optional

   libevent-2.1.11, Poppler-0.79.0, jsoncpp, libsrtp, snappy

   User Notes: http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/qtwebengine

  Installation of qtwebengine

   First, ensure that the local headers are available when not building as
   part of the complete Qt-5.13.0:

 find -type f -name "*.pr[io]" |
   xargs sed -i -e 's|INCLUDEPATH += |&$$QTWEBENGINE_ROOT/include |'

   Next, apply a patch that fixes background rendering issues in Falkon, and
   crashes on multimedia-heavy sites.

 patch -Np1 -i ../qtwebengine-5.13.0-background_rendering_fix-1.patch

   If an older version of the package's main library has been installed, when
   the package is built separately it will link to that in preference to its
   own not-yet-installed version, and fail because of missing symbols.
   Prevent that by, as the root user, moving the symlink out of the way.:

 if [ -e ${QT5DIR}/lib/libQt5WebEngineCore.so ]; then
   mv -v ${QT5DIR}/lib/libQt5WebEngineCore.so{,.old}
 fi

   Install qtwebengine by running the following commands:

 mkdir build &&
 cd    build &&

 qmake .. -- -system-ffmpeg -webengine-icu &&
 make

   This package does not come with a test suite.

   Now, as the root user:

 make install

   Remove references to the build directory from installed library dependency
   (prl) files by running the following commands as the root user:

 find $QT5DIR/ -name \*.prl \
    -exec sed -i -e '/^QMAKE_PRL_BUILD_DIR/d' {} \;

  Command Explanations

   qmake: This will build the included copy of ninja if it is not already
   installed and use it to configure the build.

   -- -system-ffmpeg -webengine-icu: If any options are passed to qmake they
   must come after '--' which must follow '..' that points to the main
   directory. The options here cause it to use system ffmpeg and system icu.
   If built as part of full Qt5, the system icu is automatically used (only)
   by Qt5Core if it is available, but unless this option is used webengine
   will always use its shipped copy of icu, adding time and space to the
   build.

   NINJAJOBS=4 make: If you patched system ninja in LFS to recognize the
   NINJAJOBS environment variable, this command will run system ninja with
   the specified number of jobs (i.e. 4). There are several reasons why you
   might want to do this:

     * Building on a subset of CPUs allows measuring the build time for that
       number of processors or to run other CPU-intensive tasks on other
       cores.

     * Improving the build speed on a less-well endowed 4-core machine. On a
       machine with a powerful CPU and plenty of RAM, running N+2 jobs (the
       ninja default for 4+ cores) for the large working sets of the C++
       compiles in this package is typically only marginally faster than
       running N jobs at a time. But for a machine with less memory it can be
       much slower.

     * Reducing the number of cores being used on long running, CPU intensive
       packages may alleviate heat problems.

  Configuring QtWebEngine

    Configuration Information

   If you are upgrading from an older minor version of this application, for
   some webpages to load you may need to clear the browser caches, e.g. for
   falkon they will be found in ~/.cache/falkon/. You will need to do this if
   the browser starts to render the page and then changes to a blank tab with
   a message that something went wrong, and a button to Retry. Even after
   removing the old caches, you may need to retry a few times for each
   affected tab.

  Installation of WebKitGTK+

    Installation of WebKitGTK+

   Install WebKitGTK+ by running the following commands:

 mkdir -vp build &&
 cd        build &&

 CFLAGS=-Wno-expansion-to-defined  \
 CXXFLAGS=-Wno-expansion-to-defined \
 cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release  \
       -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr \
       -DCMAKE_SKIP_RPATH=ON       \

       -DUSE_WOFF2=OFF             \
       -Wno-dev -G Ninja .. &&
 ninja

   This package does not have a working testsuite. However, there is a usable
   basic graphical web browser in the build directory, build/bin/MiniBrowser.
   If launching it fails, there is a problem with the build.

  Note

   When installing, the Makefile does some additional compiling and linking.
   If you do not have Xorg in /usr, the LIBRARY_PATH and PKG_CONFIG_PATH
   variables need to be defined for the root user. If using sudo to assume
   root, use the -E option to pass your current environment variables for the
   install process.

   Now, as the root user:

 ninja install &&

 install -vdm755 /usr/share/gtk-doc/html/webkit{2,dom}gtk-4.0 &&
 install -vm644  ../Documentation/webkit2gtk-4.0/html/*   \
                 /usr/share/gtk-doc/html/webkit2gtk-4.0       &&
 install -vm644  ../Documentation/webkitdomgtk-4.0/html/* \
                 /usr/share/gtk-doc/html/webkitdomgtk-4.0

  Command Explanations

   -DUSE_LIBHYPHEN=OFF: This switch disables default automatic hyphenation
   implementation. You need to install Hyphen, if you wish to enable it
   (replacing OFF with ON or just removing the switch).

   -DENABLE_MINIBROWSER=ON: This switch enables the Mini Browser compilation
   and install.

   -DUSE_LIBNOTIFY=OFF: Use this switch if you do not have libnotify
   installed.

   -DUSE_SYSTEM_MALLOC=ON: This switch enables building against the system
   installed malloc.

   -DENABLE_GEOLOCATION=OFF: Use this switch if you don't want to install
   GeoClue-2.5.3.

   -DENABLE_GTKDOC=ON: Use this switch if GTK-Doc-1.32 is installed and you
   wish to rebuild and install the API documentation.

   -DUSE_WOFF2=ON: Use this switch if the optional package woff2 is
   installed.

Chapter 26. Display Managers

Introduction

   Display Managers are graphical programs used for starting the graphical
   display (currently, the X server) and providing a login capability for a
   Window Manager or Desktop Environment.

   There are many Display Managers available. Some of the more well known
   include: GDM, KDM (deprecated), LightDM, LXDM, Slim, and SDDM.

   Among the Desktop Environments available for Linux you find:
   Enlightenment, GNOME, KDE, LXDE, LXQt, and XFce.

   Choosing a Display Manager or Desktop Environment is highly subjective.
   The choice depends on the look and feel of the packages, the resources
   (memory and disk space) required, and the utilities included.

   In this chapter, the installation instructions of some Display Managers
   are presented. Later in the book, you will find other ones, which are
   provided as part of some Desktop Environments.

   User Notes: http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/lightdm

  Installation of Lightdm

   First, create a dedicated user and group to take control of the lightdm
   daemon after it is started. Issue the following commands as the root user:

 groupadd -g 65 lightdm       &&
 useradd  -c "Lightdm Daemon" \
          -d /var/lib/lightdm \
          -u 65 -g lightdm    \
          -s /bin/false lightdm

   Install lightdm by running the following commands:

 ./configure                          \
        --prefix=/usr                 \
        --libexecdir=/usr/lib/lightdm \
        --localstatedir=/var          \
        --sbindir=/usr/bin            \
        --sysconfdir=/etc             \
        --disable-static              \
        --disable-tests               \
        --with-greeter-user=lightdm   \
        --with-greeter-session=lightdm-gtk-greeter \
        --docdir=/usr/share/doc/lightdm-1.30.0 &&
 make

   This package does not come with a test suite.

   Now, as the root user:

 make install                                                  &&
 cp tests/src/lightdm-session /usr/bin                         &&
 sed -i '1 s/sh/bash --login/' /usr/bin/lightdm-session        &&
 rm -rf /etc/init                                              &&
 install -v -dm755 -o lightdm -g lightdm /var/lib/lightdm      &&
 install -v -dm755 -o lightdm -g lightdm /var/lib/lightdm-data &&
 install -v -dm755 -o lightdm -g lightdm /var/cache/lightdm    &&
 install -v -dm770 -o lightdm -g lightdm /var/log/lightdm

   Now build the greeter:

 tar -xf ../lightdm-gtk-greeter-2.0.6.tar.gz &&
 cd lightdm-gtk-greeter-2.0.6 &&

 ./configure                      \
    --prefix=/usr                 \
    --libexecdir=/usr/lib/lightdm \
    --sbindir=/usr/bin            \
    --sysconfdir=/etc             \
    --with-libxklavier            \
    --enable-kill-on-sigterm      \
    --disable-libido              \
    --disable-libindicator        \
    --disable-static              \
    --docdir=/usr/share/doc/lightdm-gtk-greeter-2.0.6 &&

 make

   Now, as the root user:

 make install

  Command Explanations

   sed ... /usr/bin/lightdm-session: This command ensures that the initial
   login via the greeter sources /etc/profile and ~/.bash_profile. Without
   this, commands that depend on different environment variables may not work
   as expected.

  Configuring lightdm

    Config Files

   /etc/lightdm/{lightdm,users,keys}.conf

    Boot Script

   Install the /etc/rc.d/init.d/lightdm init script from the
   blfs-bootscripts-20190609

 make install-lightdm

    Starting lightdm

   If the lightdm bootscript has been installed, start lightdm by running, as
   the root user:

 /etc/rc.d/init.d/lightdm start

   By convention, X should be executed at runlevel 5, consequently, the same
   is true for lightdm. However, LFS default runlevel is 3. Changing to
   runlevel 5, from a console terminal, as root user, starts the lightdm
   bootscript, bringing up the greeter screen:

 init 5

   In order to permanently set the default to 5, starting the lightdm greeter
   screen automatically, modify /etc/inittab. As the root user:

 cp -v /etc/inittab{,-orig} &&
 sed -i '/initdefault/ s/3/5/' /etc/inittab

    Available Sessions

   The greeter offers a list of available sessions, depending on the Window
   Managers and Desktop Environments installed. The list includes sessions
   which have a corresponding .desktop file installed under
   /usr/share/xsessions. Most of the Window Managers and Desktop Environments
   automatically provide those files, but if necessary, you may include a
   custom one.

    Short Descriptions

   lightdm             is a display and login manager.                        
   lightdm-gtk-greeter is an auxiliary process that displays the greeter, a   
                       graphical user interface that performs user            
                       authentication and initiates the selected window       
                       manager or display environment.

   Install LXDM by running the following commands:

 ./configure --prefix=/usr     \
             --sysconfdir=/etc \
             --with-pam        \
             --with-systemdsystemunitdir=no &&
 make

   This package does not come with a test suite.

   Now, as the root user:

 make install

  Command Explanations

   cat > pam/lxdm << "EOF" ...: Replace default /etc/pam.d/lxdm by another
   one appropriate for BLFS.

   sed -i ... data/lxdm.conf.in: Modifications in the default configuration:
   (1) fix the background to the default one; (2) restart X when session is
   close; (3) typo; and (4) include XORG_PREFIX, which may be different from
   /usr.

   sed -i ... data/Xsession: Source /etc/profile, instead of other file,
   according to BLFS standard.

   sed -i ... data/lxdm.in: Fix greeter's locale for BLFS specification.

   --with-pam: This parameter enables use of pam authentication.

   --with-systemdsystemunitdir=no: BLFS does not support systemd.

  Configuring LXDM

    Config Files

   /etc/lxdm/lxdm.conf

    Boot Script

   Install the /etc/rc.d/init.d/lxdm init script from the
   blfs-bootscripts-20190609 package.

 make install-lxdm

    Configuration Information

   The LXDM daemon configuration file (/etc/lxdm/lxdm.conf) specifies options
   that include numlock on/off, background image (bg), session, etc. You can
   set a default session by uncommenting the line: session=/usr/bin/startlxde
   and replacing startlxde with your session of choice. For GNOME
   session=/usr/bin/gnome-session. For OPENBOX
   session=/usr/bin/openbox-session and for XFCE session=/usr/bin/startxfce4.

   It is also possible to set the preferred session on a per-user basis by
   editing the ~/.dmrc file for each user and adding:

 [Desktop]
         Session=xfce

   You can replace the default dummy face in the greeting screen by another
   image representing your user. For that, copy or symlink the desired image
   to your home directory with the name .face.

    Starting lxdm

   You can manually start lxdm, e.g, if the bootscript has been installed, by
   running, as root user:

 /etc/rc.d/init.d/lxdm start

   By convention, X should be executed at runlevel 5, consequently, the same
   is true for lxdm. However, the LFS default runlevel is 3. Changing to
   runlevel 5, from the console (as root user) starts the lxdm bootscript and
   presents the greeter screen:

 init 5

   In order to permanently set the default to 5, starting the lxdm greeter
   screen automatically, you can modify /etc/inittab. As the root user:

 cp -v /etc/inittab{,-orig} &&
 sed -i '/initdefault/ s/3/5/' /etc/inittab

   You should also disable default elogind power management:

 cat >> /etc/elogind/logind.conf << "EOF"
 AllowSuspend=no
 AllowHibernation=no
 EOF

  Note

   One important script, executed after login is /etc/lxdm/Xsession which we
   have fixed to fit BLFS specifications.

Introduction

   Window Managers and Desktop Environments are the primary user interfaces
   into the X Window System. A window manager is a program that controls the
   appearance of windows and provides the means by which the user can
   interact with them. A Desktop Environment provides a more complete
   interface to the operating system, and provides a range of integrated
   utilities and applications.

   There are many Window Managers available. Some of the more well known ones
   include fvwm2, Window Maker, AfterStep, Enlightenment, Sawfish, and
   Blackbox.

   The Desktop Environments available for Linux are GNOME, KDE, and XFce.

   Choosing a Window Manager or Desktop Environment is highly subjective. The
   choice depends on the look and feel of the packages, the resources (RAM,
   disk space) required, and the utilities included. One web site that
   provides a very good summary of what is available, screenshots, and their
   respective features is Window Managers for X.

   In this chapter, the installation instructions of several Window Managers
   and one lightweight Desktop Environment are presented. Later in the book,
   both KDE and GNOME have their own sections.

    Fluxbox Dependencies

      Required

   X Window System

      Optional

   dbus-1.12.16 (runtime), FriBidi-1.0.5, and imlib2-1.5.1 (if you wish to
   use other image formats in addition to XPM)

   User Notes: http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/fluxbox

  Installation of Fluxbox

   Install Fluxbox by running the following commands:

 ./configure --prefix=/usr &&
 make

   This package does not have a working testsuite.

   Now, as the root user:

 make install

  Configuring Fluxbox

    Config Files

   ~/.fluxbox/init, ~/.fluxbox/keys, and ~/.fluxbox/menu

    Configuration Information

   If Fluxbox is the only Window Manager you want to use, you can start it
   with an .xinitrc file in your home folder. Be sure to backup your current
   .xinitrc before proceeding.

 echo startfluxbox > ~/.xinitrc

   Or alternatively, if you use a login manager like GDM or LightDM and would
   like to be able to choose Fluxbox at the login prompt, create a
   fluxbox.desktop file like this.

   As root:

 mkdir -pv /usr/share/xsessions &&
 cat > /usr/share/xsessions/fluxbox.desktop << "EOF"
 [Desktop Entry]
 Encoding=UTF-8
 Name=Fluxbox
 Comment=This session logs you into Fluxbox
 Exec=startfluxbox
 Type=Application
 EOF

   If you didn't install GDM, SDDM, or LightDM in /usr, then change that
   command to fit the prefix you chose.

   Now create the Fluxbox configuration files:

 mkdir -v ~/.fluxbox &&
 cp -v /usr/share/fluxbox/init ~/.fluxbox/init &&
 cp -v /usr/share/fluxbox/keys ~/.fluxbox/keys

   To generate the application menu, first you may wish to run
   fluxbox-generate_menu -h, in order to choose any <user_options>, then
   issue:

 cd ~/.fluxbox &&
 fluxbox-generate_menu <user_options>

   Alternately, copy a pregenerated menu:

 cp -v /usr/share/fluxbox/menu ~/.fluxbox/menu

   Menu items are added by editing ~/.fluxbox/menu. The syntax is explained
   on the fluxbox man page.

   If you want to use an image as your desktop background, copy the theme you
   like into ~/.fluxbox. Then add a line to make it use the correct image. In
   the following command, change <theme> for the name of the theme you want
   and change </path/to/nice/image.ext> to point to the actual image you want
   to use, where ext must be âxpmâ, if imlib2-1.5.1 is not installed to allow
   other image formats.

 cp /usr/share/fluxbox/styles/<theme> ~/.fluxbox/theme &&

 sed -i 's,\(session.styleFile:\).*,\1 ~/.fluxbox/theme,' ~/.fluxbox/init &&

 [ -f ~/.fluxbox/theme ] &&
 echo "background.pixmap: </path/to/nice/image.ext>" >> ~/.fluxbox/theme ||
 [ -d ~/.fluxbox/theme ] &&
 echo "background.pixmap: </path/to/nice/image.ext>" >> ~/.fluxbox/theme/theme.cfg

   In some locales the font specified in the theme may not contain the needed
   characters. This results in menus with blank items. You can fix this by
   editing ~/.fluxbox/theme with a text editor and altering it so that it
   names a suitable font.

   Installed Directories: /usr/share/fluxbox and ~/.fluxbox

    Short Descriptions

   fluxbox                is a window manager for X11 based on Blackbox       
                          0.61.0.                                             
   fbsetbg                is a utility that sets the background image. It     
                          requires one of the following at runtime: Esetroot, 
                          wmsetbg, feh, hsetroot, chbg, display, qiv, xv,     
                          xsri, xli, or xsetbg. It also requires which if     
                          Esetroot is found.                                  
   fbsetroot              is a utility to change root window appearance based 
                          on the Blackbox application bsetroot.               
   fluxbox-generate_menu  is a utility that generates a menu by scanning your 
                          PATH.                                               
   startfluxbox           is a session startup script that allows for command 
                          executions prior to fluxbox starting.               
   fbrun                  displays a run dialog window.                       
   fluxbox-remote         provides command line access to key commands for    
                          Fluxbox.                                            
   fluxbox-update_configs use to manage config files (reload, update, test).

IceWM-1.6.1

  Introduction to IceWM

   IceWM is a window manager with the goals of speed, simplicity, and not
   getting in the user's way.

   This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS-9.0
   platform.

    Package Information

     * Download (HTTP):
       https://github.com/ice-wm/icewm/archive/1.6.1/icewm-1.6.1.tar.gz

     * Download MD5 sum: 7b4ebb3080239c649e7e9d408d075e14

     * Download size: 2.0 MB

     * Estimated disk space required: 31 MB

     * Estimated build time: 0.3 SBU (Using parallelixm=4)

    IceWM Dependencies

      Required

   X Window System and gdk-pixbuf-2.38.1

      Optional

   FriBidi-1.0.5 (for languages written right to left), librsvg-2.44.14,
   libsndfile-1.0.28 and alsa-lib-1.1.9 (for the experimental icesound
   program)

   User Notes: http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/icewm

  Installation of IceWM

   Install IceWM by running the following commands:

 sed -i "s/nullptr/NULL/" src/{wmconfig.cc,icewmhint.cc} &&

 mkdir build &&
 cd    build &&

 cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr \
       -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release  \
       -DCFGDIR=/etc               \
       -DCMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS='-lXrandr -lXinerama' \
       -DDOCDIR=/usr/share/doc/icewm-1.6.1  \
       ..
 make

   This package does not have a working testsuite.

   Now, as the root user:

 make install         &&
 rm /usr/share/xsessions/icewm.desktop

  Command Explanations

   rm /usr/share/xsessions/icewm.desktop: The package ships with both
   icewm.desktop and icewm-xsession.desktop. The former has apparently been
   used in the past, but it will hang if used with a modern desktop-manager
   such as lightdm-1.30.0.

  Configuring IceWM

    Config Files

   ~/.icewm/keys, ~/.icewm/menu, and ~/.icewm/preferences, and
   ~/.icewm/toolbar, and ~/.icewm/winoptions. The default versions are
   installed in /usr/share/icewm/ and will be used if you have not copied
   them to ~/.icewm.

    Configuration Information

   If IceWM is the only Window Manager you want to use, you can start it with
   an .xinitrc file in your home folder. Be sure to backup your current
   .xinitrc before proceeding.

 echo icewm-session > ~/.xinitrc

   Now create the IceWM configuration files:

 mkdir -v ~/.icewm                                       &&
 cp -v /usr/share/icewm/keys ~/.icewm/keys               &&
 cp -v /usr/share/icewm/menu ~/.icewm/menu               &&
 cp -v /usr/share/icewm/preferences ~/.icewm/preferences &&
 cp -v /usr/share/icewm/toolbar ~/.icewm/toolbar         &&
 cp -v /usr/share/icewm/winoptions ~/.icewm/winoptions

   You can now edit these files to meet your requirements. In particular,
   review the preferences file. You can use Logout -> Restart-IceWM on the
   main menu to load your changed preferences, but changes to the background
   only take effect when IceWM is started.

   At this point you can either modify the traditional menu files to suit
   your requirements, or use the newer icewm-menu-fdo described later.

   The syntax of the menus is explained in the help files, which you can
   access by running help from the menu, but some of the detail is out of
   date and the default selections in the menus (a few old applications on
   the main menu, everything else on the Programs menu) will benefit from
   being updated to meet your needs. The following examples are provided to
   encourage you to think about how you wish to organise your menus. Please
   note the following:

     * If a program listed in the menu has not been installed, it will not
       appear when the menu is displayed. Similarly, if the program exists
       but the specified icon does not, no icon will be displayed in the
       menu.

     * The icons can be either .xpm or .png files, and there is no need to
       specify the extension. If the icon is located in the "library"
       (/usr/share/icewm/icons) there is no need to specifiy the path.

     * Most programs are in sub-menus, and the main menu will always append
       entries for windows, help, settings, logout at the bottom.

     * An icon for firefox was copied to the library directory and given a
       meaningful name. The icon for xine is xine.xpm which was installed to
       a pixmap directory.

     * The default toolbar is not altered.

   If you wish to use this traditional method, there are more examples in
   previous releases of this book (e.g. BLFS-7.8).

   Alternatively, you can create a menu which conforms to the FDO Desktop
   Menu Specifications, where programs can be found because they have a
   .desktop file in the XDG_DATA_HOME or XDG_DATA_DIR directories. Unlike
   most windowmanagers, icewm does not search for programs when the menu is
   invoked, so if you take this route you will need to rerun the following
   command after installing or removing programs:

 icewm-menu-fdo >~/.icewm/menu

   If you wish to put icons on your desktop, you will need to install a
   program such as Rox-Filer-2.11 which provides a pinboard. If you do that
   you will no longer be able to access the menu by right-clicking on the
   desktop, you will have to use the IceWM button. To ensure that the rox
   pinboard is running, the following commands will put it in the startup
   file:

 cat > ~/.icewm/startup << "EOF"
 rox -p Default &
 EOF &&
 chmod +x ~/.icewm/startup

  Tip

   There are a number of keyboard shortcuts in IceWM:

     * Ctrl + Alt + FN : go to ttyN.

     * Ctrl + Alt + N : go to desktop number N

     * Ctrl + Alt + Space : open a box on the taskbar where you can key in
       the name of an application and run it.

   Installed Directories: /usr/share/doc/icewm-1.6.1, /usr/share/icewm and
   ~/.icewm

    Short Descriptions

   icehelp           is used to display the html manual.                      
   icesh             is a command-line window manager which can be used in    
                     ~/.icewm/startup.                                        
   icesound          plays audio files on GUI events raised by IceWM.         
   icewm             is the window manager.                                   
   icewm-menu-fdo    can create a file in a format suitable for an IceWM      
                     menu, which lists those programs currently installed in  
                     a layout conforming to the FDO Desktop Menu              
                     Specifications.                                          
   icewm-session     runs icewmbg, icewm, icewmtray, startup, shutdown (i.e.  
                     startup and shutdown scripts are run if installed).      
   icewm-set-gnomewm is a script to set the GNOMEwindowmanager to icewm using 
                     gconftool.                                               
   icewmbg           is used to set the background, according to the various  
                     DesktopBackground settings in the preferences.           
   icewmhint         is used internally.                                      
   icewmtray         provides the tray.

openbox-3.6.1

  Introduction to openbox

   Openbox is a highly configurable desktop window manager with extensive
   standards support. It allows you to control almost every aspect of how you
   interact with your desktop.

   This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS-9.0
   platform.

    Package Information

     * Download (HTTP): http://openbox.org/dist/openbox/openbox-3.6.1.tar.gz

     * Download MD5 sum: b72794996c6a3ad94634727b95f9d204

     * Download size: 944 KB

     * Estimated disk space required: 21 MB

     * Estimated build time: 0.3 SBU

    Openbox Dependencies

      Required

   X Window System and Pango-1.42.4 (compiled with support for libXft)

      Optional

   dbus-1.12.16 (runtime), imlib2-1.5.1 (to enable icons in the right click
   menu), ImageMagick-7.0.8-60 (to show desktop backgrounds as seen in the
   Configuration Information section below), PyXDG-0.25,
   startup-notification-0.12, and librsvg-2.44.14

   User Notes: http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/openbox

  Installation of Openbox

  Note

   If XORG_PREFIX is not /usr, tell gcc about it:

 export LIBRARY_PATH=$XORG_PREFIX/lib

   If you only installed the Python 3 PyXDG module convert one of the scripts
   to Python 3:

 2to3-3.7 -w data/autostart/openbox-xdg-autostart &&
 sed 's/python/python3/' -i data/autostart/openbox-xdg-autostart

   Install Openbox by running the following commands:

 ./configure --prefix=/usr     \
             --sysconfdir=/etc \
             --disable-static  \
             --docdir=/usr/share/doc/openbox-3.6.1 &&
 make

   This package does not come with a test suite.

   Now, as the root user:

 make install

  Command Explanations

   --sysconfdir=/etc: This option puts Openbox's configuration files in
   /etc/xdg/openbox instead of /usr/etc/xdg/openbox.

   --docdir=/usr/share/doc/openbox-3.6.1: this puts a few files in a
   versioned directory in /usr/share/doc.

   --disable-static: This switch prevents installation of static versions of
   the libraries.

  Configuring Openbox

    Config Files

   /etc/xdg/openbox/autostart, /etc/xdg/openbox/menu.xml,
   /etc/xdg/openbox/rc.xml, ~/.config/openbox/autostart,
   ~/.config/openbox/menu.xml and ~/.config/openbox/rc.xml

    Configuration Information

   Openbox's right click menu can be used to launch programs. The menu itself
   is configured with 2 files, /etc/xdg/openbox/menu.xml and
   ~/.config/openbox/menu.xml. To make changes to the menu, copy
   /etc/xdg/openbox/menu.xml to ~/.config/openbox/menu.xml and edit it:

 cp -rf /etc/xdg/openbox ~/.config

   ~/.config/openbox/menu.xml can be edited with a text editor or you can
   install Obmenu (requires pyxml and PyGTK-2.24.0).

   To have icons in your right click menu requires installing imlib2-1.5.1
   before you install Openbox. To set an icon for an entry in the menu edit
   ~/.config/openbox/menu.xml and add an icon to the <item> tag like this:

 <item label="Mplayer" icon="/usr/share/pixmaps/mplayer.png">

   Many other aspects of Openbox's behaviour are configured with
   ~/.config/openbox/rc.xml such as what keybindings are used to launch
   programs or which mouse button launches the main menu.

   Details of the theme that Openbox applies to window decorations are
   configured in ~/.config/openbox/rc.xml. You can get a list of the
   available themes with the command:

 ls -d /usr/share/themes/*/openbox-3 | sed 's#.*es/##;s#/o.*##'

    Starting Openbox

   To automatically start openbox when you start Xorg:

 echo openbox > ~/.xinitrc

   If you want to set a background image to your desktop you can use display
   and launch it from ~/.xinitrc just before openbox:

 cat > ~/.xinitrc << "EOF"
 display -backdrop -window root /path/to/beautiful/picture.jpeg
 exec openbox
 EOF

   Or if you like a bit of variety, put a selection of images in a folder (in
   this example, the directory ~/.config/backgrounds) and choose one at
   random each time you xinit:

 cat > ~/.xinitrc << "EOF"
 # make an array which lists the pictures:
 picture_list=(~/.config/backgrounds/*)
 # create a random integer between 0 and the number of pictures:
 random_number=$(( ${RANDOM} % ${#picture_list[@]} ))
 # display the chosen picture:
 display -backdrop -window root "${picture_list[${random_number}]}"
 exec openbox
 EOF

   If you like to have the numlock key set whan you start Xorg, install
   Numlockx and add that to your xinitrc. Another useful application is
   dbus-1.12.16:

 cat > ~/.xinitrc << "EOF"
 . /etc/profile
 picture_list=(~/.config/backgrounds/*)
 random_number=$(( ${RANDOM} % ${#picture_list[*]} ))
 display -backdrop -window root "${picture_list[${random_number}]}"
 numlockx
 eval $(dbus-launch --auto-syntax --exit-with-session)
 lxpanel &
 exec openbox
 EOF

Chapter 29. Introduction to KDE

KDE Preliminaries

   KDE is a comprehensive desktop environment with a huge number of
   applications written for it and a huge amount of users. It is based on the
   Qt framework.

   The KDE5 system has two main blocks: the libraries, called KDE Frameworks
   5 or KF5, which can be used in other environments, and the desktop
   environment called KDE Plasma 5. Most of the applications written by the
   KDE team only use KF5, and do not need the plasma environment.

      Optional

   Sphinx (for building documentation)

   User Notes: http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/extra-cmake-modules

  Installation of Extra Cmake Modules

   Install Extra Cmake Modules by running the following commands:

 sed -i '/"lib64"/s/64//' kde-modules/KDEInstallDirs.cmake &&

 sed -e '/PACKAGE_INIT/i set(SAVE_PACKAGE_PREFIX_DIR "${PACKAGE_PREFIX_DIR}")' \
     -e '/^include/a set(PACKAGE_PREFIX_DIR "${SAVE_PACKAGE_PREFIX_DIR}")' \
     -i ECMConfig.cmake.in &&

 mkdir build &&
 cd    build &&

 cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr .. &&
 make

   This package does not come with a test suite.

  Note

   Unlike other KF5 packages, this module is installed in /usr because it can
   be used by some non-KF5 packages.

   Now, as the root user:

 make install

  Command Explanations

   sed ... Modules/KDEInstallDirs.cmake: This command disables applications
   using cmake from attempting to install files in a lib64 sub-directory.

   sed ... ECMConfig.cmake.in: This command protects the global cmake
   variable PACKAGE_PREFIX_DIR from being changed when checking ECM presence:
   since we install ECM into /usr, the check would set that variable to /usr,
   while most KDE packages expect it to be set to /opt/kf5 and would fail to
   build if it is set to something else.

   Installed Programs: None
   Installed Libraries: None

Chapter 30. KDE Frameworks 5

KDE Frameworks 5 Pre-installation Configuration

   KF5 can be installed in /usr or /opt/kf5. The BLFS editors recommend the
   latter in the BLFS environment.

  Installing in /usr

   One option is to install KDE Frameworks 5 into the /usr hierarchy. This
   creates a simpler setup but makes it more difficult to try multiple
   versions of KDE Frameworks.

 export KF5_PREFIX=/usr

   It is a good idea to add the following variables to your system or
   personal profiles:

 cat >> /etc/profile.d/qt5.sh << "EOF"
 # Begin kf5 extension for /etc/profile.d/qt5.sh

 pathappend /usr/lib/qt5/plugins    QT_PLUGIN_PATH
 pathappend $QT5DIR/lib/plugins     QT_PLUGIN_PATH

 pathappend /usr/lib/qt5/qml        QML2_IMPORT_PATH
 pathappend $QT5DIR/lib/qml         QML2_IMPORT_PATH

 # End extension for /etc/profile.d/qt5.sh
 EOF

 cat > /etc/profile.d/kf5.sh << "EOF"
 # Begin /etc/profile.d/kf5.sh

 export KF5_PREFIX=/usr

 # End /etc/profile.d/kf5.sh
 EOF

  Note

   If qt5 was installed in /usr, the $QT5DIR/lib/ portions of the above paths
   may need to be changed to $QT5DIR/lib/qt5/.

   Additionally, if Sudo-1.8.27 is installed, these variables should be
   available to the super user. Execute the following commands as the root
   user:

 cat >> /etc/sudoers.d/qt << "EOF"
 Defaults env_keep += QT_PLUGIN_PATH
 Defaults env_keep += QML2_IMPORT_PATH
 EOF

 cat >> /etc/sudoers.d/kde << "EOF"
 Defaults env_keep += KF5_PREFIX
 EOF

  Installing in /opt

   A method of building multiple versions installs KDE Frameworks 5 in the
   /opt hierarchy:

 export KF5_PREFIX=/opt/kf5

   If you are not installing KDE Frameworks 5 in /usr, you will need to make
   some additional configuration changes. Best practice is to add those to
   your system or personal profile:

 cat > /etc/profile.d/kf5.sh << "EOF"
 # Begin /etc/profile.d/kf5.sh

 export KF5_PREFIX=/opt/kf5

 pathappend $KF5_PREFIX/bin              PATH
 pathappend $KF5_PREFIX/lib/pkgconfig    PKG_CONFIG_PATH

 pathappend $KF5_PREFIX/etc/xdg          XDG_CONFIG_DIRS
 pathappend $KF5_PREFIX/share            XDG_DATA_DIRS

 pathappend $KF5_PREFIX/lib/plugins      QT_PLUGIN_PATH
 pathappend $KF5_PREFIX/lib/plugins/kcms QT_PLUGIN_PATH

 pathappend $KF5_PREFIX/lib/qml          QML2_IMPORT_PATH

 pathappend $KF5_PREFIX/lib/python3.7/site-packages PYTHONPATH

 pathappend $KF5_PREFIX/share/man        MANPATH
 # End /etc/profile.d/kf5.sh
 EOF

 cat >> /etc/profile.d/qt5.sh << "EOF"
 # Begin Qt5 changes for KF5

 pathappend $QT5DIR/plugins             QT_PLUGIN_PATH
 pathappend $QT5DIR/qml                 QML2_IMPORT_PATH

 # End Qt5 changes for KF5
 EOF

   Expand your /etc/ld.so.conf file:

 cat >> /etc/ld.so.conf << "EOF"
 # Begin KF5 addition

 /opt/kf5/lib

 # End KF5 addition
 EOF

   Several KDE Frameworks 5 packages install files into D-Bus directories.
   When installing KDE Frameworks 5 in a location other than /usr, D-Bus
   needs to be able to find these files. The easiest way to achieve this is
   to create the following symlinks (as the root user):

 install -v -dm755           $KF5_PREFIX/{etc,share} &&
 ln -sfv /etc/dbus-1         $KF5_PREFIX/etc         &&
 ln -sfv /usr/share/dbus-1   $KF5_PREFIX/share

   Some packages may also install icons from the "hicolor" icon set. Since
   that icon set is used by many packages, it is a good idea to create a
   symlink to the one in /usr/share to avoid having multiple installations of
   hicolor-icon-theme-0.17. Run the following commands as the root user:

 install -v -dm755                $KF5_PREFIX/share/icons &&
 ln -sfv /usr/share/icons/hicolor $KF5_PREFIX/share/icons

  Tip

   Sometimes, the installation paths are hardcoded into installed files. This
   is the reason why /opt/kf5 is used as installation prefix instead of
   /opt/kf5-5.61.0. After installing KDE Frameworks, you may rename the
   directory and create a symlink:

 mv /opt/kf5{,-5.61.0}
 ln -sfv kf5-5.61.0 /opt/kf5

   Later on, you may want to install other versions of KDE Frameworks 5. To
   do that, just remove the symlink and use /opt/kf5 as the prefix again.
   Which version of KDE Frameworks 5 you use depends only on where the
   symlink points. No other reconfiguration will be needed.

  Downloading KDE Frameworks

   The easiest way to get the KDE Frameworks packages is to use a single wget
   to fetch them all at once:

 url=http://download.kde.org/stable/frameworks/5.61/
 wget -r -nH -nd -A '*.xz' -np $url
 The options used here are:
   -r            recurse through child directories
   -nH           disable generation of host-prefixed directories
   -nd           do not create a hierarchy of directories
   -A '*.xz'     just get the *.xz files
   -np           don't get parent directories

 EOF

   In the above list, notice that some files have been commented out with a
   hash (#) character. The extra-cmake-modules entry has been commented out
   because it was built earlier in the Introduction to KDE. The icon packages
   are covered separately at breeze-icons-5.61.0 and oxygen-icons5-5.61.0.
   The modemmanager-qt package may be built if its optional dependency has
   been installed. The prison package (bar code reader) may be built if the
   required external libraries are installed. The kdewebkit may be built if
   the external package QtWebkit has been built.

  Installation of KDE Frameworks

  Note

   When installing multiple packages in a script, the installation needs to
   be done as the root user. There are three general options that can be used
   to do this:

    1. Run the entire script as the root user (not recommended).

    2. Use the sudo command from the Sudo-1.8.27 package.

    3. Use su -c "command arguments" (quotes required) which will ask for the
       root password for every iteration of the loop.

   One way to handle this situation is to create a short bash function that
   automatically selects the appropriate method. Once the command is set in
   the environment, it does not need to be set again.

 as_root()
 {
   if   [ $EUID = 0 ];        then $*
   elif [ -x /usr/bin/sudo ]; then sudo $*
   else                            su -c \\"$*\\"
   fi
 }

 export -f as_root

  Caution

   If installing in /opt and there is an existing /opt/kf5 either as a
   regular directory or a symbolic link, it should be reinitialized (as
   root):

 mv -v /opt/kf5 /opt/kf5.old                         &&
 install -v -dm755           $KF5_PREFIX/{etc,share} &&
 ln -sfv /etc/dbus-1         $KF5_PREFIX/etc         &&
 ln -sfv /usr/share/dbus-1   $KF5_PREFIX/share

   First, start a subshell that will exit on error:

 bash -e

   Install all of the packages by running the following commands:

 while read -r line; do

     # Get the file name, ignoring comments and blank lines
     if $(echo $line | grep -E -q '^ *$|^#' ); then continue; fi
     file=$(echo $line | cut -d" " -f2)

     pkg=$(echo $file|sed 's|^.*/||')          # Remove directory
     packagedir=$(echo $pkg|sed 's|\.tar.*||') # Package directory

     name=$(echo $pkg|sed 's|-5.*$||') # Isolate package name

     tar -xf $file
     pushd $packagedir
   
       mkdir build
       cd    build

       cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$KF5_PREFIX \
             -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=$QT5DIR        \
             -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release         \
             -DBUILD_TESTING=OFF                \
             -Wno-dev ..
       make
       as_root make install
     popd

   as_root rm -rf $packagedir
   as_root /sbin/ldconfig

 done < frameworks-5.61.0.md5

 exit

  Note

   Any modules that have been omitted can be installed later by using the
   same mkdir build; cd build; cmake; make; make install procedure as above.

   Sometimes the installation paths are hardcoded into installed files. If
   the installed directory is not /usr, rename the directory and create a
   symlink:

 mv -v /opt/kf5 /opt/kf5-5.61.0
 ln -sfvn kf5-5.61.0 /opt/kf5

  Command Explanations

   -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=$QT5DIR: This switch is used to allow cmake to find
   the proper Qt libraries.

   -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release: This switch is used to apply higher level of
   the compiler optimizations.

   -DBUILD_TESTING=OFF: This switch is used to prevent building test programs
   and libraries that are of no use to an end user.

   Installed Programs: There are 48 programs installed in /opt/kf5/bin.
   Installed Libraries: There are too many kf5 libraries (191) to list
   separately.

k3b-19.08.0

  Introduction to K3b

   The K3b package contains a KF5-based graphical interface to the Cdrtools
   and dvd+rw-tools CD/DVD manipulation tools. It also combines the
   capabilities of many other multimedia packages into one central interface
   to provide a simple-to-operate application that can be used to handle many
   of your CD/DVD recording and formatting requirements. It is used for
   creating audio, data, video and mixed-mode CDs as well as copying, ripping
   and burning CDs and DVDs.

   Though k3b can be used to copy almost any DVD to similar medium, it does
   not provide a way to copy, or reproduce a double-layer DVD onto
   single-layer medium. Of course, there is not a program anywhere on any
   platform that can make an exact duplicate of a double-layer DVD onto a
   single-layer disk, there are programs on some platforms that can compress
   the data on a double-layer DVD to fit on a single-layer DVD producing a
   duplicate, but compressed, image. If you need to copy the contents of a
   double-layer DVD to single-layer medium, you may want to look at the
   RMLCopyDVD package.

   This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS-9.0
   platform.

    K3b Dependencies

      Required

   KDE Frameworks-5.61.0, libkcddb-19.08.0, libsamplerate-0.1.9, and
   shared-mime-info-1.12

   The CD/DVD drive is detected at run time using UDisks-2.8.4, which must
   therefore be installed before running k3b.

      Recommended

   FFmpeg-4.2, libburn-1.5.0, libdvdread-6.0.1, and taglib-1.11.1

   There are programs from three packages that k3b will look for at runtime:
   Cdrtools-3.02a09 (required to burn CD-ROM media), dvd+rw-tools-7.1
   (required to burn or format DVD media), and Cdrdao-1.2.4 (required to burn
   CD-ROM media in DAO (Disk At Once) mode). If you don't need the capability
   provided by any of the three packages, you don't have to install it.
   However, a warning message will be generated every time you run the k3b
   program if any are not installed.

      Optional

   FLAC-1.3.3, LAME-3.100, libmad-0.15.1b, libsndfile-1.0.28,
   libvorbis-1.3.6, libmusicbrainz-2.1.5, and Musepack (libmpcdec)

Further KDE5 packages

   This section did not provide instructions for all of the available
   packages in the KDE5 Software Compilation. The included packages were
   selected based on what most people would want to use on a standard desktop
   computer.

   For a full list of available packages, have a look on the KDE5 servers at
   http://download.kde.org/stable/applications/19.08.0/src,

  Note

   Some packages, such as kde-baseapps, kde-runtime, and kmag listed in the
   link above are only for the older KDE4 and cannot be used with KF5.

   Some additional packages worth mentioning are:

     * Juk: A lightweight music player.

     * Dragon: A video player.

     * Kcalc: A scientific calculator.

     * Kaccessible: Integration of accessibility utilities.

     * Kwalletmanager: A credentials management application.

     * Marble: A global map program.

     * A variety (about 40) of KDE games including: kpat, kfourinline, and
       kmines.

  Note

   Some packages will require additional dependencies. To determine what
   dependencies are needed, run from the top of the source tree:

 cmake -Wno-dev -L .

   Most of these packages can be built with the standard KDE5 instructions:

 mkdir build &&
 cd    build &&

 cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$KF5_PREFIX \
       -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release         \
       -DBUILD_TESTING=OFF                \

Chapter 32. KDE Plasma 5

   KDE Plasma 5 is a desktop environment built using KDE Frameworks 5 and QML
   which runs on top of a fully hardware accelerated graphics stack using
   Qt5, QtQuick 2 and an OpenGL(-ES) scenegraph.

   No additional configuration is needed before building the KDE Plasma 5
   because it uses the same configuration that KDE Frameworks 5 uses.

  Note

   The breeze-grub, breeze-plymouth, and plymouth-kcm packages above are all
   for customized support of Plymouth which is designed to be run within an
   initial ram disk during boot (see the section called âAbout initramfsâ).
   The plasma-sdk package is optional and used for software development.

  Installation of Plasma5

  Note

   When installing multiple packages in a script, the installation needs to
   be done as the root user. There are three general options that can be used
   to do this:

    1. Run the entire script as the root user (not recommended).

    2. Use the sudo command from the Sudo-1.8.27 package.

    3. Use su -c "command arguments" (quotes required) which will ask for the
       root password for every iteration of the loop.

   One way to handle this situation is to create a short bash function that
   automatically selects the appropriate method. Once the command is set in
   the environment, it does not need to be set again.

 as_root()
 {
   if   [ $EUID = 0 ];        then $*
   elif [ -x /usr/bin/sudo ]; then sudo $*
   else                            su -c \\"$*\\"
   fi
 }

 export -f as_root

   First, start a subshell that will exit on error:

 bash -e

   Install all of the packages by running the following commands:

 while read -r line; do

     # Get the file name, ignoring comments and blank lines
     if $(echo $line | grep -E -q '^ *$|^#' ); then continue; fi
     file=$(echo $line | cut -d" " -f2)

     pkg=$(echo $file|sed 's|^.*/||')          # Remove directory
     packagedir=$(echo $pkg|sed 's|\.tar.*||') # Package directory

     tar -xf $file
     pushd $packagedir

        # Fix some build issues when generating some configuration files
        case $name in
          plasma-workspace)
            sed -i '/set.HAVE_X11/a set(X11_FOUND 1)' CMakeLists.txt
          ;;
      
          khotkeys)
            sed -i '/X11Extras/a set(X11_FOUND 1)' CMakeLists.txt
          ;;
      
          plasma-desktop)
            sed -i '/X11.h)/i set(X11_FOUND 1)' CMakeLists.txt
          ;;
        esac

        mkdir build
        cd    build

        cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$KF5_PREFIX \
              -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release         \
              -DBUILD_TESTING=OFF                \
              -Wno-dev ..  &&

         make
         as_root make install
     popd


     as_root rm -rf $packagedir
     as_root /sbin/ldconfig

 done < plasma-5.16.4.md5

 exit

   If you did not set $KF5_PREFIX to /usr, create symlinks to allow display
   managers to find Plasma:

 as_root install -dvm 755 /usr/share/xsessions              &&
 cd /usr/share/xsessions/                                   &&
 [ -e plasma.desktop ]                                      ||
 as_root ln -sfv $KF5_PREFIX/share/xsessions/plasma.desktop &&
 as_root install -dvm 755 /usr/share/wayland-sessions       &&
 cd /usr/share/wayland-sessions/                            &&
 [ -e plasma.desktop ]                                      ||
 as_root ln -sfv $KF5_PREFIX/share/wayland-sessions/plasma.desktop

  Configuring Plasma

    Linux PAM Configuration

   If you built Plasma with the recommended Linux PAM support, create
   necessary configuration files by running the following commands as the
   root user:

 cat > /etc/pam.d/kde << "EOF"
 # Begin /etc/pam.d/kde

 auth     requisite      pam_nologin.so
 auth     required       pam_env.so

 auth     required       pam_succeed_if.so uid >= 1000 quiet
 auth     include        system-auth

 account  include        system-account
 password include        system-password
 session  include        system-session

 # End /etc/pam.d/kde
 EOF

 cat > /etc/pam.d/kde-np << "EOF"
 # Begin /etc/pam.d/kde-np

 auth     requisite      pam_nologin.so
 auth     required       pam_env.so

 auth     required       pam_succeed_if.so uid >= 1000 quiet
 auth     required       pam_permit.so

 account  include        system-account
 password include        system-password
 session  include        system-session

 # End /etc/pam.d/kde-np
 EOF

 cat > /etc/pam.d/kscreensaver << "EOF"
 # Begin /etc/pam.d/kscreensaver

 auth    include system-auth
 account include system-account

 # End /etc/pam.d/kscreensaver
 EOF

  Starting Plasma5

   You can start Plasma5 from runlevel 3, using xinit-1.4.1, or from runlevel
   5, using a Display Manager, such as lightdm-1.30.0.

   To start Plasma 5 using xinit-1.4.1, run the following commands:

 cat > ~/.xinitrc << "EOF"
 dbus-launch --exit-with-session $KF5_PREFIX/bin/startkde
 EOF

 startx

   The X session starts on the first unused virtual terminal, normally vt7.
   You can switch to another vtn simultaneously pressing the keys Ctrl-Alt-Fn
   (n=1, 2, ...). To switch back to the X session, normally started at vt7,
   use Ctrl-Alt-F7. The vt where the command startx was executed will display
   many messages, including X starting messages, applications automatically
   started with the session, and eventually, some warning and error messages.
   You may prefer to redirect those messages to a log file, which not only
   will keep the initial vt uncluttered, but can also be used for debugging
   purposes. This can be done starting X with:

 startx &> ~/x-session-errors

   When shutting down or rebooting, the shutdown messages appear on the vt
   where X was running. If you wish to see those messages, simultaneously
   press keys Alt-F7 (assuming that X was running on vt7).

   If you intend to start Plasma using a display manager such as
   lightdm-1.30.0, there will be two entries for Plasma, one for use with
   Xorg, and another for Wayland. Modify the Xorg entry with the following
   command, as the root user, so that you can differentiate between the two:

 sed '/^Name=/s/Plasma/Plasma on Xorg/' -i /usr/share/xsessions/plasma.desktop

       .. &&
 make

   This package does not come with a working test suite.

   Now, as the root user:

 make install

  Command Explanations

   -DENABLE_GOOGLE=ON: This default flag enables access to google services
   via libgdata-0.17.11 and also enables the Google Authentication option.

   -DENABLE_VALA_BINDINGS=ON: This switch enables building the Vala bindings.
   Remove if you don't have Vala-0.44.7 installed.

   -DENABLE_GTK_DOC=OFF: This switch disables building the API documentation.
   It is broken for this package due to the use of a long deprecated gtk-doc
   program that is no longer available.

   -DWITHSYSTEMDUSERUNITDIR=no: This switch disables installing the systemd
   units, which are not used for a Sysv build.

  Note

   To enable many of the optional dependencies, review the information from
   cmake -L CMakeLists.txt for the necessary parameters you must pass to the
   cmake command.

   This package does not come with a test suite.

   Now, as the root user:

 ninja install

  Note

   If you installed the package to your system using a âDESTDIRâ method,
   /usr/share/glib-2.0/schemas/gschemas.compiled was not updated/created.
   Create (or update) the file using the following command as the root user:

 glib-compile-schemas /usr/share/glib-2.0/schemas

  Command Explanations

   -D<option>=false: These switches are required if the corresponding
   optional dependency is not installed. Remove those where you have
   installed the corresponding application and wish to use it with Gvfs. The
   dnssd option requires avahi and both goa/google require GNOME Online
   Accounts.

   -Dtmpfilesdir=no -Dsystemduserunitdir=no: These switches provide systemd
   directory locations. Setting them to ânoâ disables the dependency on
   systemd and logind.

   -Dcdda=false: This switch is required if libcdio is not installed. The
   cdda backend is useless on machines without a CDROM/DVD drive.

    GDM Dependencies

      Required

   AccountsService-0.6.55, GTK+-3.24.10, ISO Codes-4.3, itstool-2.0.6,
   keyutils-1.6, libcanberra-0.30, libdaemon-0.14, and Linux-PAM-1.3.1

      Runtime Dependencies

   gnome-session-3.32.0, gnome-shell-3.32.2, and elogind-241.3

   User Notes: http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/gdm

  Installation of GDM

   It is recommended to have a dedicated user and group to take control of
   the gdm daemon after it is started. Issue the following commands as the
   root user:

 groupadd -g 21 gdm &&
 useradd -c "GDM Daemon Owner" -d /var/lib/gdm -u 21 \
         -g gdm -s /bin/false gdm &&
 passwd -ql gdm

  Note

   The gdm login screen is managed by gnome-shell, which relies on the
   systemd-localed daemon to get the system settings. Since this daemon is
   not present on this system, a sed is applied in the gnome-shell-3.32.2
   instructions to change this behavior, but then gdm uses the system
   settings, which default to a US âqwertyâ keyboard layout. This may be an
   inconvience to enter a password when the machine keyboard has a different
   layout. One possibility is to use the screen-keyboard from the
   accessibility menu. Another possibility is to change the defaults at
   compile time, by creating the following file:

 cat > data/dconf/defaults/01-keyboard << EOF
 [org/gnome/desktop/input-sources]
 sources=[('xkb','layout')]
 EOF

   where layout should be replaced with the acronym for your keyboard layout
   (one of the filenames in /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols).

   Install GDM by running the following commands:

 sed 's@systemd@elogind@' -i data/pam-lfs/gdm-launch-environment.pam &&

 ./configure --prefix=/usr         \
             --sysconfdir=/etc     \
             --localstatedir=/var  \
             --without-plymouth    \
             --disable-static      \
             --enable-gdm-xsession \
             --with-systemdsystemunitdir=no \
             --with-pam-mod-dir=/lib/security &&
 make

   This package does not come with a usable test suite.

   Now, as the root user:

 make install

  Command Explanations

   --disable-static: This switch prevents installation of static versions of
   the libraries.

   --with-initial-vt=7: Use this switch to make GDM start on VT7 instead of
   the first free VT.

   --without-plymouth: GDM now explicitly requires plymouth to be installed.
   Use this switch to disable this dependency.

   --with-default-pam-config=lfs: Use this switch if you did not create the
   /etc/lfs-release file or distribution auto detection will fail and you
   will be unable to use GDM.

   --enable-gdm-xsession: This enables the installation of the GDM Xsession
   file.

  Configuring GDM

    Config Files

   /etc/gdm/custom.conf

    Configuration Information

   The GDM daemon is configured using the /etc/gdm/custom.conf file. Default
   values are stored in GSettings in the gdm.schemas file. It is recommended
   that end-users modify the /etc/gdm/custom.conf file because the schemas
   file may be overwritten when the user updates their system to have a newer
   version of GDM.

    Boot Script

   To start the gdm automatically when the system is booted, install the
   /etc/rc.d/init.d/gdm init script included in the blfs-bootscripts-20190609
   package and set the default runlevel to 5 (graphical login) as the root
   user:

 make install-gdm

   In order to permanently set the default runlevel to 5, starting the gdm
   greeter screen automatically, you can modify /etc/inittab. As the root
   user:

 sed /initdefault/s/3/5/ -i /etc/inittab

   You should also disable default elogind power management:

 cat >> /etc/elogind/logind.conf << "EOF"
 AllowSuspend=no
 AllowHibernation=no
 EOF

  Contents

   Installed Programs: gdm, gdmflexiserver, and gdm-screenshot

   /usr/share/help/*/gdm, /var/cache/gdm, /var/lib/gdm, /var/log/gdm, and
   /var/run/gdm

    Short Descriptions

   gdm            is a login prompt for GNOME.  
   gdm-screenshot is a screenshot tool for GDM.

   User Notes: http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/xfce4-session

  Installation of Xfce4 Session

   Install Xfce4 Session by running the following commands:

 ./configure --prefix=/usr \
             --sysconfdir=/etc \
             --disable-legacy-sm &&
 make

   This package does not come with a test suite.

   Now, as the root user:

 make install

  Command Explanations

   --disable-legacy-sm: This switch disables legacy session management which
   isn't necessary on modern system.

  Configuring Xfce4 Session

   There are several optional run time dependencies for Xfce4: dbus-1.12.16,
   GnuPG-2.2.17, hicolor-icon-theme-0.17 and OpenSSH-8.0p1

   When building an Xfce4 package, some configuration files are installed in
   /usr/share/applications, /usr/share/icons, and /usr/share/mime. In order
   to use those files in your Xfce4 session, you need to update various
   databases. Do that by running, as the root user (you need to have the
   recommended dependencies installed):

 update-desktop-database &&
 update-mime-database /usr/share/mime

  Starting Xfce4

   You can start Xfce4 from runlevel 3, using xinit-1.4.1, or from runlevel
   5, using a Display Manager, such as lightdm-1.30.0.

   To start Xfce4 using xinit-1.4.1, run the following commands:

 cat > ~/.xinitrc << "EOF"
 dbus-launch --exit-with-session startxfce4
 EOF

 startx

   The X session starts on the first unused virtual terminal, normally vt7.
   You can switch to another vtn simultaneously pressing the keys Ctrl-Alt-Fn
   (n=1, 2, ...). To switch back to the X session, normally started at vt7,
   use Ctrl-Alt-F7. The vt where the command startx was executed will display
   many messages, including X starting messages, applications automatically
   started with the session, and eventually, some warning and error messages.
   You may prefer to redirect those messages to a log file, which not only
   will keep the initial vt uncluttered, but can also be used for debugging
   purposes. This can be done starting X with:

 startx &> ~/.x-session-errors

  Note

   You may wish to drop dbus-launch, e.g., just using startxfce4 in
   ~/.xinitrc. However some capabilities such as mounting or umounting file
   systems from a file manager will not be possible, or the reboot option
   will be absent or inoperative, among other problems.

   When shutting down or rebooting, the shutdown messages appear on the vt
   where X was running. If you wish to see those messages, simultaneously
   press keys Alt-F7 (assuming that X was running on vt7).

   Now, as the root user:

 make install

   If you have installed recommended dependencies, run the following commands

  Starting LXDE

   You can start LXDE from runlevel 3, using xinit-1.4.1, or from runlevel 5,
   using a Display Manager, such as lxdm-0.5.3.

   To start LXDE using xinit-1.4.1, run the following commands:

 cat > ~/.xinitrc << "EOF"
 # No need to run dbus-launch, since it is run by startlxde
 startlxde
 EOF

 startx

   The X session starts on the first unused virtual terminal, normally vt7.
   You can switch to another vtn simultaneously pressing the keys Ctrl-Alt-Fn
   (n=1, 2, ...). To switch back to the X session, normally started at vt7,
   use Ctrl-Alt-F7. The vt where the command startx was executed will display
   many messages, including X starting messages, applications automatically
   started with the session, and eventually, some warning and error messages.
   You may prefer to redirect those messages to a log file, which not only
   will keep the initial vt uncluttered, but can also be used for debug
   purposes. This can be done starting X with:

 startx &> ~/.x-session-errors

   When shutting down or rebooting, the shutdown messages appear on the vt
   where X was running. If you wish to see those messages, simultaneously
   press keys Alt-F7 (assuming that X was running on vt7).

   --enable-plugins="collab openxml goffice grammar": Build some or all
   plugins. The openxml plugin enables Abiword to open some .docx files. The
   grammar plugin requires Link Grammar Parser

  Configuring AbiWord

    Config File

   ~/.AbiSuite/templates/normal.awt

    Configuration Information

   Choose the right template for your language and locale from the list
   produced by the following command:

 ls /usr/share/abiword-3.0/templates

   Create the folder ~/.AbiSuite/templates then copy the normal.awt you want
   into it:

 install -v -m750 -d ~/.AbiSuite/templates &&
 install -v -m640    /usr/share/abiword-3.0/templates/normal.awt-<lang> \
                     ~/.AbiSuite/templates/normal.awt

   Change <lang> by the above command to fit the name of the file you want.

   If you are using multiple languages, you may need to edit the template to
   use a font with greater coverage (e.g. one of the Dejavu fonts, because
   Abiword does not use fontconfig and can only display glyphs that are
   provided in the chosen font.

   If you have desktop-file-utils-0.24 installed, you should run the
   update-desktop-database command to update the mimeinfo cache and allow the
   Help system to work.

   If you have xdg-utils-1.1.3 installed, you should run the
   xdg-icon-resource forceupdate --theme hicolor command, for the installed
   icon to be displayed in the menu item.

   User Notes: http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/libreoffice

  Installation of LibreOffice

  Important

   Unlike the other packages, we assume that you have not yet unpacked the
   package. This is because the --no-overwrite-dir switch is needed in case
   you unpack as the root user.

 tar -xf libreoffice-6.3.0.4.tar.xz --no-overwrite-dir &&
 cd libreoffice-6.3.0.4

   Create symlinks to tarballs from the source directory so they won't get
   downloaded again:

 install -dm755 external/tarballs &&
 ln -sv ../../../libreoffice-dictionaries-6.3.0.4.tar.xz external/tarballs/ &&
 ln -sv ../../../libreoffice-help-6.3.0.4.tar.xz         external/tarballs/

   If you have downloaded the translations tarball, create a symlink:

 ln -sv ../../../libreoffice-translations-6.3.0.4.tar.xz external/tarballs/

  Note

   During the build process, some packages will be downloaded (including the
   ones listed as recommended and optional dependencies) if they are not
   present on the system. Because of this, build time may vary from the
   published time more than usual.

   Due to the large size of the package, you may prefer to install it in
   /opt, instead of /usr. Depending on your choice, replace <PREFIX> by /usr
   or by /opt/libreoffice-6.3.0.4:

 export LO_PREFIX=<PREFIX>

   Locales "fr" and "en-GB", you will find below, are just examples; you
   should change them to suit your needs - you might want to read the
   "Command Explanations", further below, before proceeding.

   Prepare LibreOffice for compilation by running the following commands:

 sed -e "/gzip -f/d"   \
     -e "s|.1.gz|.1|g" \
     -i bin/distro-install-desktop-integration &&

 sed -e "/distro-install-file-lists/d" -i Makefile.in &&

 sed -e '/JAVA_SOURCE_VER/s/6/7/' \
     -e '/JAVA_TARGET_VER/s/6/7/' \
     -i configure.ac

   The instructions below will only build the package without running any
   unit tests. If you prefer to run the unit tests, replace make
   build-nocheck with make build or (as a regular user only) just make, but
   do not be surprised if a unit test fails right at the end of the build and
   breaks it.

   Build the package:

 make build-nocheck

   Now, as the root user:

 make distro-pack-install

   If installed in /opt/libreoffice-6.3.0.4 some additional steps are
   necessary. Issue the following commands, as root user:

 if [ "$LO_PREFIX" != "/usr" ]; then

   # This symlink is necessary for the desktop menu entries
   ln -svf $LO_PREFIX/lib/libreoffice/program/soffice /usr/bin/libreoffice &&

   # Set up a generic location independent of version number
   ln -sfv libreoffice-6.3.0.4 /opt/libreoffice

   # Icons
   mkdir -vp /usr/share/pixmaps
   for i in $LO_PREFIX/share/icons/hicolor/32x32/apps/*; do
     ln -svf $i /usr/share/pixmaps
   done &&

   # Desktop menu entries
   for i in $LO_PREFIX/lib/libreoffice/share/xdg/*; do
     ln -svf $i /usr/share/applications/libreoffice-$(basename $i)
   done &&

   # Man pages
   for i in $LO_PREFIX/share/man/man1/*; do
     ln -svf $i /usr/share/man/man1/
   done

   unset i
 fi

   If you have installed desktop-file-utils-0.24, and you wish to update the
   MIME database, issue, as the root user:

 update-desktop-database

   The suite and main modules can be started from the menu. From a terminal,
   the suite can be started with libreoffice command and the modules with
   libreoffice --<module> command, respectively, where <module> is one of
   base, calc, draw, impress, math or writer. Modules cannot be started using
   their shell starting script names (see "Installed Programs", below), if
   LO_PREFIX is other than /usr, unless $LO_PREFIX/bin directory is appended
   to the PATH.

  Command Explanations

   sed -e ...: The first sed prevents compression of the manual pages, the
   second one prevents the install from failing, and the the third allows to
   build with OpenJDK-12.

   --with-vendor=BLFS: This switch sets BLFS as the vendor which is mentioned
   when you click "About" from the Help menu on the toolbar.

   --with-lang='fr en-GB': This switch sets what languages to support. To
   list several languages, separate them with a space. For all languages, use
   --with-lang=ALL.

  Note

   For a list of the available languages, look in solenv/inc/langlist.mk.

   --with-help: Without this switch, the help files are not built.

   --with-jdk-home=/opt/jdk: This parameter will silence a warning that the
   configure script attempted to find JAVA_HOME automatically (even though
   that is passed in the environment). Omit this if you disabled java.

   --with-myspell-dicts: This switch adds myspell dictionaries to the
   LibreOffice installation set.

   --with-system-boost: This switch enables using system boost. From time to
   time, recent versions of boost break the build of libreoffice. In this
   case, it is possible to use the bundled copy of boost, by removing this
   flag.

   --disable-dconf: This switch disables compiling LibreOffice with the GNOME
   DConf configuration system support.

   -disable-gtk -enable-gtk3: This pair of switches tell the configure script
   to use GTK+-3 instead of GTK+-2.

   --without-junit: This switch disables the tests for the deprecated HSQLDB
   driver which is written in Java. If you wish to build this driver replace
   this switch with the set of switches described below after
   '--without-java'.

   --without-system-dicts: This switch disables use of dictionaries from
   system paths, so the ones installed by this package are used.

   --disable-odk: This switch disables installing the office development kit.
   Remove if you want to develop a LibreOffice based application.

   --enable-release-build=yes: This switch enables a Release Build.
   LibreOffice can be built as a Release Build or as a Developer Build,
   because their default installation paths and user profile paths are
   different. Developer Build displays the words "Dev" and "Beta" in several
   places (e.g, menu and splash screen).

   --enable-python=system: This switch tells LibreOffice to use installed
   Python 3 to build the translations instead of the bundled one.

   --with-system-*: These switches prevent LibreOffice from trying to compile
   its own versions of these dependencies. If you've not installed some of
   the dependencies, remove the corresponding switches.

   make distro-pack-install: this does a normal install, but if you add a
   DESTDIR environment variable it will also install a lot of (text)
   gid_Module_* files in the DESTDIR, to help distributions which want to
   break the package into parts.

   --with-parallelism=<count>: This switch tells LibreOffice to use <count>
   CPU cores to compile in parallel. (Do not include literal angle brackets.)
   The default is to use all available cores on the system.

   --disable-cups: Use this switch if you don't need printing support.

   --disable-dbus: Use this switch if you've not installed D-Bus-1.8.0 or
   later. It also disables Bluetooth support and font install via PackageKit.

   --disable-firebird-sdbc: By default, the ability to connect to a firebird
   database is enabled. Add this switch if you do not need that feature.

   --disable-gstreamer-1-0: Use this switch if you have not installed
   gst-plugins-base-1.16.0.

   --disable-gtk3: Use this switch if you have not installed GTK+-3, or if
   you have installed it but wish to use GTK+-2 (the menu icons differ).

   --disable-postgresql-sdbc: This switch disables compiling LibreOffice with
   the ability to connect to a PostgreSQL database. Use it if you have not
   installed PostgreSQL and you do not want LibreOffice to compile its
   bundled copy.

   --enable-lto: This switch will enable Link Time Optimization, which
   results in slightly smaller libraries (about 40 MB). This is said to make
   LibreOffice programs load faster (and possibly run faster, e.g. when
   recalculating a spreadsheet). On an 8-core machine with 16GB of memory,
   the difference in compile times was minimal, but an extra 2GB was used for
   the work files. On machines with fewer processors or a lack of memory, the
   compile might be much slower.

   --without-java: This switch disables Java support in LibreOffice. Java is
   needed for the deprecated HSQLDB driver, which allows reading databases
   created by other programs or in earlier versions of libreoffice base.

   --with-junit=/opt/ant/lib/junit-4.12.jar and
   --with-hamcrest=/opt/ant/lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar: Those options are
   needed if you want to run the tests.

   --without-fonts: LibreOffice includes a number of third-party TrueType
   fonts. If you have already installed some or all of the same fonts, you
   may prefer to use the system versions.

   --enable-kde5: Builds with KDE/Plasma integration. If Qt-5.13.0 and/or KDE
   Frameworks-5.61.0 are not installed in /usr, the include and library
   directories must be specified in QT5INC, QT5LIB, KF5INC, and KF5LIB,
   respectively.

Falkon-3.0.1

  Introduction to falkon

   Falkon is a KDE web browser using the QtWebEngine rendering engine. It was
   previously known as QupZilla. It aims to be a lightweight web browser
   available through all major platforms.

   Although falkon is now part of KDE, it can be installed without KDE (with
   the loss of kwallet functionality, and of translations of the
   (not-installed) example hellopython.py script).

   This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS-9.0
   platform.

    Package Information

     * Download (HTTP):

     * Download size: 2.1 MB

     * Estimated disk space required: 113 MB

     * Estimated build time: 1.2 SBU (Using parallelism=4)

    falkon Dependencies

      Required

   extra-cmake-modules-5.61.0, qtwebengine-5.13.0

      Optional

   gnome-keyring-3.28.2, KDE Frameworks-5.61.0 (for ki18n if installing the
   translations of hellopython.py, or for kwallet and its dependencies), and
   PySide2 for experimental Python plugins (compiling this from source is
   very slow).

   User Notes: http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/falkon

  Installation of falkon

   Install falkon by running the following commands:

   Unless you have installed both PySide2 and ki18n, remove the translations
   for the sample hellopython.py script:

 rm -rf po/

   Now build the program:

 mkdir build &&
 cd    build &&

 cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr \
       -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release  \
       .. &&

 make

   To test the results, issue: make test. All tests should pass. If any fail,
   the full results will be in Testing/Temporary/LastTest.log.

   Now, as the root user:

 make install

   If you have installed Pyside2 you will want to examine the hellopython.py
   which is in the scripts/ directory, and perhaps copy it to your home
   directory.

  Command Explanations

   -DBUILD_TESTING=OFF: This will save a little time and space by not
   building the test programs, use this if you do not wish to run the test.

  Contents

   Installed Programs: falkon
   Installed Library: libFalkonPrivate.so.3
   Installed Directory: ${FALKON_PREFIX}/lib/plugins,
   ${FALKON_PREFIX}/share/falkon.

    Short Descriptions

   falkon                is a web browser which uses qtwebengine. 
   libFalkonPrivate.so.3 contains functions used by falkon.

   to 0755 if you have permission to do that. If you do this in a directory
   where the sticky bit is set, such as /tmp it will end with error messages:

   tar: .: Cannot utime: Operation not permitted
   tar: .: Cannot change mode to rwxr-xr-t: Operation not permitted
   tar: Exiting with failure status due to previous errors

   This does finish with non-zero status, but it does NOT mean there is a
   real problem. Do not untar as the root user in a directory where the
   sticky bit is set - that will unset it.

   As with other large packages which use C++ (or rust), the SBU times to
   build this vary more widely than you might expect. Also, 6GB of real
   memory is used during the final link and the SBUs can increase
   significantly if the machine has to swap.

   The mach build system (Python scripts) can be somewhat unreliable: if the
   build fails and reports an Error, it can still return a status of success,
   causing a scripted build to try to install (which does not rerun the
   build), fail during the preparations for installing, but still exit with a
   status of success. Also, on occasion it may limit itself to only running
   one set of jobs - that will make the build take about 3 times as long as
   running with four sets of jobs.

   Although upstream prefer to use PulseAudio, for the moment Alsa can still
   be used. Both may need runtime configuration to get sound working.

  Installation of Firefox

   The configuration of Firefox is accomplished by creating a mozconfig file
   containing the desired configuration options. A default mozconfig is
   created below. To see the entire list of available configuration options
   (and an abbreviated description of some of them), issue ./mach configure
   && ./configure --help | less. You may also wish to review the entire file
   and uncomment any other desired options. Create the file by issuing the
   following command:

 cat > mozconfig << "EOF"
 # If you have a multicore machine, all cores will be used by default.

 # If you have installed dbus-glib, comment out this line:
 ac_add_options --disable-dbus

   Compile Firefox by issuing the following commands:

   If you have installed system versions of graphite2 and harfbuzz and wish
   firefox to use those instead of its shipped versions, apply the patch and

  Note

   If you are compiling Firefox in chroot, make sure you have $SHELL
   environment variable set or prepend SHELL=/bin/sh. Also ensure that
   /dev/shm is mounted.

   If you are still using ICU-63, run a sed to avoid a conflict between
   upstream ICU's use of CheckImpl() in their public headers and firefox's
   internal use of a different CheckImpl().

 sed -e 's/checkImpl/checkFFImpl/g' -i js/src/vm/JSContext*.h

   If you are building on i686, apply a fix to prevent Internal Compiler
   Errors in GCC-7+:

 case $(uname -m) in
    i?86) sed -i "562 s/mips64/i386/" gfx/skia/skia/third_party/skcms/src/Transform_inl.h ;;
 esac

   Now invoke the Python2 script to compile the package.

 export CC=gcc CXX=g++ &&
 export MOZBUILD_STATE_PATH=${PWD}/mozbuild &&
 ./mach build

   The mozconfig above disables the tests because they use a lot more time
   and disk space for no obvious benefit. If you have nevertheless enabled
   them, you can run the tests by executing ./mach gtest. This will require a
   network connection, and to be run from within an Xorg session - there is a
   popup dialog when it fails to connect to ALSA (that does not create a
   failed test). One or two tests will fail. To see the details of the
   failure(s) you will need to log the output from that command so that you
   can review it.

   Now, as the root user:

 ./mach install                                                  &&

 mkdir -pv  /usr/lib/mozilla/plugins                             &&
 ln    -sfv ../../mozilla/plugins /usr/lib/firefox/browser/

   Set environment variables back to their values:

 unset CC CXX MOZBUILD_STATE_PATH

  Command Explanations

   sed -e 's/checkImpl/checkFFImpl/g' ...: Although the package ships with a
   modified version of ICU-63 and only tests that the system version, if
   used, is at least 63, changes from upstream 63 cause builds with the
   system version to fail with an error message no void
   JSContext::checkImpl_63 member function. The sed renames the local
   function. Upstream ICU-64 works around this.

   export CC=gcc CXX=g++ ...: Upstream now prefer clang, but gcc is a more
   secure compiler and now produces reasonably-sized builds.

   export MOZBUILD_STATE_PATH=${PWD}/mozbuild: The build is now supposed to
   tell you that it intends to create ~/.mozbuild, and offer you an option to
   press <ENTER> to accept this, or Ctrl-C to cancel and restart the build
   after specifying the directory. In practice, the message may not appear
   until after <ENTER> is keyed, i.e. the build stalls.

   That directory is used for a (probably random) telemetry identifier.
   Creating this in the build directory, and deleting that after the
   installation, prevents it being used. If you wish to participate in
   telemetry, export MOZBUILD_STATE_PATH to point to its default directory.

   ./mach build: Firefox now uses this python2 script to run the build and
   install.

   ./mach build --verbose: Use this alternative if you need details of which
   files are being compiled, together with any C or C++ flags being used.

   ./mach build -jN: The build should, by default, use all the online CPU
   cores. There are two reasons to specify the number of cores, e.g. -j4 for
   4 cores: First, if using all the cores causes the build to swap because
   you have insufficient memory (e.g. for 4 cores a build without system
   graphite2 and harfbuzz now uses towards 8GB of RAM). In such cases, using
   fewer cores can be faster. Second, on some machines the middle part of the
   build can drag on as if only one core is present. In those cases,
   specifying the number of cores may speed up the build.

   mkdir -pv /usr/lib/mozilla/plugins: This ensures that
   /usr/lib/mozilla/plugins/ exists.

   ln -sv ... /usr/lib/firefox/browser: This command creates a symbolic link
   to /usr/lib/mozilla/plugins. It's not really needed, as Firefox checks
   /usr/lib/mozilla/plugins by default, but the symbolic link is made to keep
   all the plugins installed in one folder.

   export CC=clang CXX=clang++ AR=llvm-ar NM=llvm-nm RANLIB=llvm-ranlib: Use
   this as an alternative to building with gcc and g++ if you wish to use the
   clang toolchain. Remember to unset these variables after the build.

  Configuring Firefox

   If you use a desktop environment like Gnome or KDE you may like to create
   a firefox.desktop file so that Firefox appears in the panel's menus. If
   you didn't enable startup-notification in your mozconfig change the
   StartupNotify line to false. As the root user:

 mkdir -pv /usr/share/applications &&
 mkdir -pv /usr/share/pixmaps &&

 cat > /usr/share/applications/firefox.desktop << "EOF" &&
 [Desktop Entry]
 Encoding=UTF-8
 Name=Firefox Web Browser
 Comment=Browse the World Wide Web
 GenericName=Web Browser

 StartupNotify=true
 EOF

 ln -sfv /usr/lib/firefox/browser/chrome/icons/default/default128.png \
         /usr/share/pixmaps/firefox.png

    Configuration Information

   The application settings for firefox are accessible by keying about:config
   in the address bar.

   With this version of firefox, getting working sound can be a problem.
   Although upstream prefers pulseaudio, on balance using Alsa may be easier.

   If you enabled Alsa for sound, you may need to alter one variable to get
   working sound. If you run firefox from a term and try to play something
   with sound you might encounter error messages like:

   Sandbox: seccomp sandbox violation: pid 3941, tid 4030, syscall 16, args
   48 2147767296 139909894784796 0 0 0.

   That was on x86_64, on i686 the syscall number is 54. To allow this
   syscall, in about:config change security.sandbox.content.syscall_whitelist
   to 16 (or 54 if using i686).

   If you use pulseaudio in a Desktop Environment, it might already be
   started by that DE. But if it is not, although firefox-57 managed to start
   it, firefox-58 did not. If you run firefox from a term and this problem is
   present, trying to play sound will encounter error messages warning Can't
   get cubeb context!

   The fix for this is to close firefox, start pulseaudio to check it does
   start (if not, read the information on Configuring in PulseAudio-12.2) and
   restart firefox to check it is working. If it now works, add the following
   to your ~/.xinitrc: pulseaudio --verbose --log-target=syslog&
   (unfortunately, on some systems this does not work).

   You may wish to use multiple profiles within firefox. To do that, invoke
   firefox as firefox --ProfileManager. You can also check which profile is
   currently in use from about:profiles.

SeaMonkey-2.49.4

  Introduction to SeaMonkey

   SeaMonkey is a browser suite, the Open Source sibling of Netscape. It
   includes the browser, composer, mail and news clients, and an IRC client.
   It is the follow-on to the Mozilla browser suite.

   The Mozilla project also hosts two subprojects that aim to satisfy the
   needs of users who don't need the complete browser suite or prefer to have
   separate applications for browsing and e-mail. These subprojects are
   Firefox-68.0.2 and Thunderbird-68.0. Both are based on the Mozilla source
   code.

   This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS-9.0
   platform.

  Note

   If you are compiling SeaMonkey in chroot, make sure you have the SHELL
   environment variable set or prepend SHELL=/bin/sh to the first make
   command below.

   GCC-9 generates some false positives with -Werror=format, which prevent
   building SeaMonkey. Remove this flag with the following command:

 grep -rl -- '-Werror=format' | xargs sed -i 's/error=format/no-&/'

   Remove a function definition, which is incompatible with the one in
   glibc-2.30:

 sed -i -e '/pid_t gettid/,+3 s@^@//@' mozilla/tools/profiler/core/platform.h

   Compile SeaMonkey by running the following commands:

 CC=gcc CXX=g++ make -f client.mk

  Note

   The CC and CXX variables above are only needed if LLVM-8.0.1 is installed
   and you do not want to use clang.

   This package does not come with a test suite.

   Install SeaMonkey by issuing the following commands as the root user:

 make  -f client.mk install INSTALL_SDK= &&
 chown -R 0:0 /usr/lib/seamonkey-2.49.4    &&

 cp -v $(find -name seamonkey.1 | head -n1) /usr/share/man/man1

    All the Development Libraries and Headers

   If you want to install the full SeaMonkey development environment, as the
   root user:

 make -C obj* install

  Note

   The build directory is set by the make procedure and is dependent on the
   system architecture, but the directory name starts with 'obj'.

  Command Explanations

   make -f client.mk: Mozilla products are packaged to allow the use of a
   configuration file which can be used to pass the configuration settings to
   the configure command. make uses the client.mk file to get initial
   configuration and setup parameters.

  Configuring SeaMonkey

   For installing various SeaMonkey plugins, refer to Mozdev's PluginDoc
   Project.

   Along with using the âPreferencesâ menu to configure SeaMonkey's options
   and preferences to suit individual tastes, finer grain control of many
   options is only available using a tool not available from the general menu
   system. To access this tool, you'll need to open a browser window and
   enter about:config in the address bar. This will display a list of the
   configuration preferences and information related to each one. You can use
   the âFilter:â bar to enter search criteria and narrow down the listed
   items. Changing a preference can be done using two methods. One, if the
   preference has a boolean value (True/False), simply double-click on the
   preference to toggle the value and two, for other preferences simply
   right-click on the desired line, choose âModifyâ from the menu and change
   the value. Creating new preference items is accomplished in the same way,
   except choose âNewâ from the menu and provide the desired data into the
   fields when prompted.

  Tip

   There is a multitude of configuration parameters you can tweak to
   customize SeaMonkey. A very extensive list of these parameters can be
   found at http://preferential.mozdev.org/preferences.html.

   If you use a desktop environment like Gnome or KDE you may wish to create
   a seamonkey.desktop file so that SeaMonkey appears in the panel's menus.
   If you didn't enable Startup-Notification in your mozconfig change the
   StartupNotify line to false. As the root user:

       languages)

     * Estimated build time: 0.8 SBU (en only), 13 SBU, with parallelism=4,
       for all languages

    Gimp Dependencies

      Required

   gegl-0.4.16, gexiv2-0.12.0, glib-networking-2.60.3, GTK+-2.24.32,
   HarfBuzz-2.6.0. libjpeg-turbo-2.0.2, libmypaint-1.3.0, librsvg-2.44.14,
   LibTIFF-4.0.10, libxml2-2.9.9 (for Python2) (to build the translated help
   files), Little CMS-2.9, mypaint-brushes-1.3.0, Poppler-0.79.0 (including
   poppler-data) and X Window System

      Recommended

   dbus-glib-0.110, ghostscript-9.27 (with libgs installed), Gvfs-1.40.2 (to
   access the online help), ISO Codes-4.3, libgudev-233, PyGTK-2.24.0
   (including the gtk, pango and pangocairo modules) and xdg-utils-1.1.3

      Optional

   AAlib-1.4rc5, alsa-lib-1.1.9, libmng-2.0.3, libwebp-1.0.3, OpenJPEG-2.3.1,
   an MTA (that provides a sendmail program), GTK-Doc-1.32, appstream-glib
   and libwmf

   When you have run configure, you will see that WebKit is not found - that
   dependency is for the legacy webkit-1.0 which should never be used on a
   modern system exposed to the internet.

      Optional, for building the help system

   dblatex (for PDF docs), pngnq and pngcrush to optimize the png files, but
   see the note on the help download above

   User Notes: http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/gimp

  Installation of Gimp

   Install Gimp by running the following commands:

 ./configure --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc &&
 make

   To test the results (requires an X-Windowed terminal) issue: make check.

   Now, as the root user:

 make install

  Note

   This package installs icon files into the /usr/share/icons/hicolor
   hierarchy and desktop files into the /usr/share/applications hierarchy.
   You can improve system performance and memory usage by updating
   /usr/share/icons/hicolor/index.theme and
   /usr/share/applications/mimeinfo.cache. To perform the update you must
   have GTK+-2.24.32 or GTK+-3.24.10 installed (for the icon cache) and
   desktop-file-utils-0.24 (for the desktop cache) and issue the following
   commands as the root user:

 gtk-update-icon-cache -qtf /usr/share/icons/hicolor &&
 update-desktop-database -q

  Installation of Gimp-Help

   The gimp-help tarball contains images and English text help for help
   files, together with translations. Because of the issues mentioned in the
   note above, you are recommended to use the online help, either by building
   against Gvfs-1.40.2 so that 'help' can open the latest XML files in your
   browser, or else you can manually open the html in your browser by going
   to https://docs.gimp.org/2.10/en (change the language code if desired).

   If you nevertheless wish to install local copies of the help files to read
   offline, unpack the gimp-help tarball and change into the root of the
   newly created source tree. Prepare for the build with the following
   command:

 ALL_LINGUAS="ca da de el en en_GB es fi fr it ja ko nl nn pt_BR ro ru zh_CN" \
 ./autogen.sh --prefix=/usr

   Remove from ALL_LINGUAS the codes for any languages which you do not wish
   to install. Alternatively, remove the line starting with ALL_LINGUAS, if
   you wish to build all languages.

   Now build the help files:

 make

   Issue the following commands as the root user to install the help files:

 make install &&
 chown -R root:root /usr/share/gimp/2.0/help

  Command Explanations

   ALL_LINGUAS="ca da de el en en_GB ...": by default, the help files will be
   rendered in all the available languages. Remove the codes of any languages
   you do not wish to build.

   --disable-python: This option is necessary if you have not installed
   PyGTK.

   --enable-gtk-doc: Use this parameter if GTK-Doc is installed and you wish
   to rebuild and install the API documentation.

Gparted-1.0.0

  Introduction to Gparted

   Gparted is the Gnome Partition Editor, a Gtk 2 GUI for other command line
   tools that can create, reorganise or delete disk partitions.

   This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS-9.0
   platform.

    Package Information

     * Download (HTTP):
       https://downloads.sourceforge.net/gparted/gparted-1.0.0.tar.gz

     * Download MD5 sum: 025160c642b64148818761a1a4f599eb

     * Download size: 3.8 MB

     * Estimated disk space required: 88 MB

     * Estimated build time: 0.4 SBU (using parallelism=4)

    Gparted Dependencies

      Required

   Gtkmm-3.24.1 and parted-3.2

      Optional

   btrfs-progs-5.2.1 (if using a btrfs filesystem) and udftools

   User Notes: http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/gparted

  Installation of Gparted

   Install Gparted by running the following commands:

 ./configure --prefix=/usr    \
             --disable-doc    \
             --disable-static &&
 make

   This package does not come with a testsuite.

   Now, as the root user:

 make install

  Command Explanations

   --disable-static: This switch prevents installation of static versions of
   the libraries.

   --disable-doc: This switch disables building of the optional
   documentation. Remove it if you have installed GNOME Doc Utils.

   --enable-xhost-root: This switch provides an interim workaround to allow
   GParted to run under Wayland by using xhost to grant and revoke root
   access to the X11 display.

  Using Gparted

   To manipulate file systems Gparted has a run time dependency on various
   file system tools (you only need to install the tools for file systems you
   actually use): Hdparm-9.58 (required for optionally displaying serial
   number device information), btrfs-progs-5.2.1, dosfstools-4.1, e2fsprogs
   (installed as part of LFS), jfsutils-1.1.15, ntfs-3g-2017.3.23,
   reiserfsprogs-3.6.27, xfsprogs-5.2.1, mtools (required to read and write
   FAT16/32 volume labels and UUIDs), hfsutils, hfsprogs, nilfs-utils and
   Reiser4progs.

   Root privileges are required to run Gparted. If you wish to run the
   application from the menu, further applications and configurations are
   necessary. Examples of applications that may be used: gksu, kdesudo, or
   xdg-su. Another simple solution is ssh-askpass-8.0p1.

    ssh-askpass

   To optionally use ssh-askpass-8.0p1 if it is installed in your system, run
   the following commands as the root user:

 cp -v /usr/share/applications/gparted.desktop /usr/share/applications/gparted.desktop.back &&
 sed -i 's/Exec=/Exec=sudo -A /'               /usr/share/applications/gparted.desktop

   Now, clicking on the menu item for Gparted, a dialog appears on the
   screen, asking for the administrator password.

   Now, as the root user:

 make install                      &&
 rm -v /usr/lib/inkscape/lib*_LIB.a

  Note

   This package installs icon files into the /usr/share/icons/hicolor
   hierarchy and desktop files into the /usr/share/applications hierarchy.
   You can improve system performance and memory usage by updating
   /usr/share/icons/hicolor/index.theme and
   /usr/share/applications/mimeinfo.cache. To perform the update you must
   have GTK+-2.24.32 or GTK+-3.24.10 installed (for the icon cache) and
   desktop-file-utils-0.24 (for the desktop cache) and issue the following
   commands as the root user:

 update-desktop-database -q

  Command Explanations

   -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release: This switch is used to build the release
   library without any debug `assert` in the code.

   rm -v /usr/lib/inkscape/lib*_LIB.a: The conversion of the package to use
   cmake has led to these libraries getting installed, but they are not
   usable (there are no header files to let a program know what they
   contain). So remove them.

   -DWITH_DBUS=ON: use this if you wish to use inkscape in interactive
   scripts which manipulate images.

     * Download MD5 sum: 0eebf05a67f7932367750ebf9faf215d

     * Download size: 1.8 MB

     * Estimated disk space required: 19 MB

     * Estimated build time: 0.3 SBU

    rox-filer Dependencies

      Required

   libglade-2.6.4 and shared-mime-info-1.12

   User Notes: http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/rox-filer

  Kernel Configuration

   If you want rox-filer to be able to update the contents of a directory
   when changes are made to the files by other applications (eg, if a script
   is running) you will need to enable dnotify support in your kernel. In
   make menuconfig:

 File systems --->
   [*] Dnotify support   [CONFIG_DNOTIFY]

   Save the new .config and then compile the kernel.

  Installation of Rox-Filer

   Compile rox-filer with the following commands:

 cd ROX-Filer                                                        &&
 sed -i 's:g_strdup(getenv("APP_DIR")):"/usr/share/rox":' src/main.c &&

 mkdir build                        &&
 pushd build                        &&
   ../src/configure LIBS="-lm -ldl" &&
   make                             &&
 popd

   Now install it as the root user:

 mkdir -p /usr/share/rox                              &&
 cp -av Help Messages Options.xml ROX images style.css .DirIcon /usr/share/rox &&

 cp -av ../rox.1 /usr/share/man/man1                  &&
 cp -v  ROX-Filer /usr/bin/rox                        &&
 chown -Rv root:root /usr/bin/rox /usr/share/rox      &&

 cd /usr/share/rox/ROX/MIME                           &&
 ln -sv text-x-{diff,patch}.png                       &&
 ln -sv application-x-font-{afm,type1}.png            &&
 ln -sv application-xml{,-dtd}.png                    &&
 ln -sv application-xml{,-external-parsed-entity}.png &&
 ln -sv application-{,rdf+}xml.png                    &&
 ln -sv application-x{ml,-xbel}.png                   &&

 ln -sv application-x-{gzip,lzma}.png                 &&
 ln -sv application-{msword,rtf}.png

  Command Explanations

   sed -i 's:g_strdup(getenv("APP_DIR")):"/usr/share/rox":' src/main.c: This
   command hard codes /usr/share/rox as the directory for rox-filer's private
   files. Without this sed rox needs the environment variable ${APP_DIR} to
   be set.

   ln -sv application-...: These commands duplicate the icons for some common
   mime types. Without these links rox-filer would just display the default
   "unknown binary blob" icon.

  Configuring RoxFiler

    Configuration Information

   Most of the configuration of rox-filer is achieved by right clicking on a
   rox-filer window and choosing "Options" from the menu. It stores its
   settings in ~/.config/rox.sourceforge.net.

   A rox-filer feature is that if there is an executable file called AppRun
   in a directory rox-filer will first run AppRun before it opens the folder.

   As an example of how this may be used, if you have ssh access to another
   computer (perhaps another computer on your local network) with ssh
   configured for passwordless logins and you have sshfs-3.5.2 installed you
   can use AppRun to mount the remote computer in a local folder using sshfs.
   For this example AppRun script to work the folder must have the same name
   as the hostname of the remote computer:

 cat > /path/to/hostname/AppRun << "HERE_DOC"
 #!/bin/bash

 MOUNT_PATH="${0%/*}"
 HOST=${MOUNT_PATH##*/}
 export MOUNT_PATH HOST
 sshfs -o nonempty ${HOST}:/ ${MOUNT_PATH}
 rox -x ${MOUNT_PATH}
 HERE_DOC

 chmod 755 /path/to/hostname/AppRun

   That works fine for mounting, but to unmount it the command fusermount -u
   ${MOUNTPOINT} is ran. You could set that as your default umount command in
   your rox preferences, but you would then be unable to unmount any normal
   mountpoints (that need umount). A script is needed that will unmount a
   Fuse mountpoint with fusermount -u ${MOUNTPOINT} and everything else with
   umount. As the root user:

 cat > /usr/bin/myumount << "HERE_DOC" &&
 #!/bin/bash
 sync
 if mount | grep "${@}" | grep -q fuse
 then fusermount -u "${@}"
 else umount "${@}"
 fi
 HERE_DOC

 chmod 755 /usr/bin/myumount

   Now, to make Rox use this simple script, open a Rox window, right click on
   it and choose Options from the menu. In the left hand list choose "Action
   windows" and then on the right hand side, where it says "Unmount command"
   change umount to myumount.

   If you use a desktop environment like Gnome or KDE you may like to create
   a rox.desktop file so that rox-filer appears in the panel's menus. As the
   root user:

 ln -s ../rox/.DirIcon /usr/share/pixmaps/rox.png &&
 mkdir -p /usr/share/applications &&

 cat > /usr/share/applications/rox.desktop << "HERE_DOC"

rxvt-unicode-9.22

  Introduction to rxvt-unicode

   rxvt-unicode is a clone of the terminal emulator rxvt, an X Window System
   terminal emulator which includes support for XFT and Unicode.

   This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS-9.0
   platform.

    Package Information

     * Download (HTTP):

     * Download size: 910 KB

     * Estimated disk space required: 23 MB (plus 9 MB if gdk-pixbuf is
       present)

     * Estimated build time: 0.2 SBU

    rxvt-unicode Dependencies

      Required

   X Window System

      Optional

   gdk-pixbuf-2.38.1 (for background images) and startup-notification-0.12

   User Notes: http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/rxvt-unicode

  Installation of rxvt-unicode

   Install rxvt-unicode by running the following commands:

 ./configure --prefix=/usr --enable-everything &&
 make

   This package does not come with a test suite.

   Now, as the root user:

 make install

  Command Explanations

   --enable-everything: Add support for all non-multichoice options. Details
   about the different options can be found in the file README.configure.

   --disable-xft: Remove support for Xft fonts.

   --disable-perl: Disable the embedded Perl interpreter.

   --disable-afterimage: Remove support for libAfterImage.

  Configuring rxvt-unicode

   The rxvt-unicode terminal emulator uses the resource class URxvt and the
   resource name urxvt. You can add X resource definitions to a user's
   ~/.Xresources or ~/.Xdefaults files or to the system-wide
   /etc/X11/app-defaults/URxvt file. The following example will load the
   matcher Perl extension (assuming Perl support wasn't disabled), which
   enables a left button click to open an underlined URL in the specified
   browser, sets a background and foreground color and loads an Xft font (as
   the root user):

 cat >> /etc/X11/app-defaults/URxvt << "EOF"
 ! Use the specified colour as the windows background colour [default white]
 URxvt*background: black

 ! Use the specified colour as the windows foreground colour [default black]
 URxvt*foreground: yellow

 ! Select the fonts to be used. This is a comma separated list of font names
 URxvt*font: xft:Monospace:pixelsize=18

 ! Comma-separated list(s) of perl extension scripts (default: "default")
 URxvt*perl-ext: matcher

 ! Specifies the program to be started with a URL argument. Used by
 URxvt*url-launcher: firefox

 ! When clicked with the mouse button specified in the "matcher.button" resource
 ! (default 2, or middle), the program specified in the "matcher.launcher"
 ! resource (default, the "url-launcher" resource, "sensible-browser") will be
 ! started with the matched text as first argument.
 ! Below, default modified to mouse left button.
 URxvt*matcher.button:     1
 EOF

   In order to view the defined X resources, issue:

 xrdb -query

   In order to add the modifications of the new user configuration file,
   keeping previously X configurations (of course, unless you are changing
   any on previously define), issue:

 xrdb -merge ~/.Xresources

   The rxvt-unicode application can also run in a daemon mode, which makes it
   possible to open multiple terminal windows within the same process. The
   urxvtc client then connects to the urxvtd daemon and requests a new
   terminal window. Use this option with caution. If the daemon crashes, all
   the running processes in the terminal windows are terminated.

   You can start the urxvtd daemon in the system or personal startup X
   session script (e.g., ~/.xinitrc) by adding the following lines near the
   top of the script:

 # Start the urxvtd daemon
 urxvtd -q -f -o &

   For more information, examine the urxvt, urxvtd, urxvtc, and urxvtperl man
   pages.

   If you use a Desktop Environment, a menu entry can be included, issuing,
   as the root user:

 cat > /usr/share/applications/urxvt.desktop << "EOF" &&
 [Desktop Entry]
 Encoding=UTF-8
 Name=Rxvt-Unicode Terminal
 Comment=Use the command line
 GenericName=Terminal
 Exec=urxvt
 Terminal=false
 Type=Application
 Icon=utilities-terminal
 Categories=GTK;Utility;TerminalEmulator;
 #StartupNotify=true
 Keywords=console;command line;execute;
 EOF

   User Notes: http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/Thunderbird

  Installation of Thunderbird

  Note

   The build process for Thunderbird can use 8GB+ of RAM when linking. Make
   sure that you have adequate swap or RAM before continuing.

   The configuration of Thunderbird is accomplished by creating a mozconfig
   file containing the desired configuration options. A default mozconfig is
   created below. To see the entire list of available configuration options
   (and a brief description of each), issue mozilla/configure --help. Create
   the file with the following command:

 cat > mozconfig << "EOF"
 # If you have a multicore machine, the build may be faster if using parallel
 # jobs. The build system automatically adds -jN to the "make" flags, where N
 # is the number of CPU cores. The option below is therefore useless, unless
 # you want to use a smaller number of jobs:
 #mk_add_options MOZ_MAKE_FLAGS="-j1"

 # If you have installed dbus-glib, comment out this line:
 ac_add_options --disable-dbus

 # If you have installed wireless-tools comment out this line:
 ac_add_options --disable-necko-wifi

 # Uncomment these lines if you have installed optional dependencies:
 #ac_add_options --enable-startup-notification

 # Comment out following option if you have PulseAudio installed
 ac_add_options --disable-pulseaudio

 # Comment out following option if you have gconf installed
 ac_add_options --disable-gconf

 # If you want to compile the Mozilla Calendar, uncomment this line:
 #ac_add_options --enable-calendar

 # Comment out following options if you have not installed
 # recommended dependencies:
 ac_add_options --enable-system-sqlite
 ac_add_options --with-system-libevent
 ac_add_options --with-system-nspr
 ac_add_options --with-system-nss
 ac_add_options --with-system-icu

 # The BLFS editors recommend not changing anything below this line:
 ac_add_options --prefix=/usr
 ac_add_options --enable-application=comm/mail

 ac_add_options --disable-crashreporter
 ac_add_options --disable-updater
 ac_add_options --disable-debug
 ac_add_options --disable-tests

 ac_add_options --enable-optimize=-O2
 ac_add_options --enable-strip
 ac_add_options --enable-install-strip

 ac_add_options --enable-official-branding

 ac_add_options --enable-system-ffi
 ac_add_options --enable-system-pixman

 ac_add_options --with-system-bz2
 ac_add_options --with-system-jpeg
 ac_add_options --with-system-png
 ac_add_options --with-system-zlib
 EOF

   Compile Thunderbird by issuing the following commands:

  Note

   If you are compiling Thunderbird in chroot, prepend SHELL=/bin/sh to the
   build command below.

   First, disable failure caused by undocumented rust macros:

 sed -i -e '/#!\[deny(missing_docs)\]/d' servo/components/style/lib.rs &&
 sed -i -e 's/#!\[deny(unsafe_code, missing_docs)\]/#!\[deny(unsafe_code)\]/g' servo/components/style_traits/lib.rs

   Remove a function definition, which is incompatible with the one in
   glibc-2.30:

 sed -i -e '/pid_t gettid/s@^@//@' tools/profiler/core/platform.h

   Next, build the package:

 ./mach build

   This package does not come with a test suite.

   Install Thunderbird by running the following commands as the root user:

 ./mach install

  Command Explanations

   ./mach build: Thunderbird now uses this python2 script to run the build
   and install.

   ./mach build --verbose: Use this alternative if you need details of which
   files are being compiled, together with any C or C++ flags being used.

  Configuring Thunderbird

    Configuration Information

   If your Window or Desktop Manager does not allow you to configure a
   default browser, you can add a configuration parameter to Thunderbird so
   that a browser will start when when you click on an
   Internet/intranet/local URL. The procedure to check or modify any of the
   configuration parameters is quite simple and the instructions here can be
   used to view or modify any of the parameters.

   First, open the configuration dialog by opening the âEditâ drop-down menu.
   Choose âPreferencesâ and then click on the âAdvancedâ icon on the top menu
   bar. Choose the âGeneralâ tab and click on the âConfig Editorâ button.
   This will display a list of the configuration preferences and information
   related to each one. You can use the âFilter:â bar to enter search
   criteria and narrow down the listed items. Changing a preference can be
   done using two methods. One, if the preference has a boolean value
   (True/False), simply double-click on the preference to toggle the value
   and two, for other preferences simply right-click on the desired line,
   choose âModifyâ from the menu and change the value. Creating new
   preference items is accomplished in the same way, except choose âNewâ from
   the menu and provide the desired data into the fields when prompted.

   The configuration preference item you need to check so that Thunderbird
   uses a specified browser is the network.protocol-handler.app.http which
   should be set to the path of the desired browser, e.g. /usr/bin/firefox.

  Tip

   There is a multitude of configuration parameters you can tweak to
   customize Thunderbird. A very extensive, but not so up-to-date list of
   these parameters can be found at
   http://preferential.mozdev.org/preferences.html.

   If you use a desktop environment such as GNOME or KDE, a desktop file
   thunderbird.desktop may be created, in order to include a âThunderbirdâ
   entry in the menu. If you didn't enable startup-notification in your
   mozconfig, then change the StartupNotify line to false. Run the following
   commands as the root user:

 mkdir -pv /usr/share/{applications,pixmaps} &&

 cat > /usr/share/applications/thunderbird.desktop << "EOF" &&
 [Desktop Entry]

 #Install server
 ( cd unix/xserver/hw/vnc && make install ) &&

 [ -e /usr/bin/Xvnc ] || ln -svf $XORG_PREFIX/bin/Xvnc /usr/bin/Xvnc

  Command Explanations

   tar -xf .. xorg-server...: This command extracts the standard Xorg package
   into the tree in a location needed for modification.

   --disable ...: Most options that are usually needed for the standard Xorg
   server are not needed for the Xvnc instance being built.

   [ -e /usr/bin/Xvnc ] || ln ... Xvnc: If the Xvnc server is not installed
   in the /usr/bin directory, then create a link so the vncserver script can
   find it.

  Configuring Tigervnc

   The user specific configuration files of vncserver resides in the .vnc
   directory in the user's home directory. The xstartup file in that
   directory is a script specifying what commands to be run when a VNC
   desktop is started. If no xstartup file exists, vncserver will try to
   start an xterm in a twm session. An example xstartup would be:

 #!/bin/sh
 [ -x /etc/vnc/xstartup ] && exec /etc/vnc/xstartup
 [ -r $HOME/.Xresources ] && xrdb $HOME/.Xresources
 startlxde &

XScreenSaver-5.43

  Introduction to XScreenSaver

   The XScreenSaver is a modular screen saver and locker for the X Window
   System. It is highly customizable and allows the use of any program that
   can draw on the root window as a display mode. The purpose of XScreenSaver
   is to display pretty pictures on your screen when it is not in use, in
   keeping with the philosophy that unattended monitors should always be
   doing something interesting, just like they do in the movies. However,
   XScreenSaver can also be used as a screen locker, to prevent others from
   using your terminal while you are away.

   This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS-9.0
   platform.

  Installation of XScreenSaver

   First, remove some C++ comments from C code that prevents one file from
   compiling:

 sed -i '/^\/\//d' hacks/fontglide.c

   Change a harcoded library name, which prevents using the settings found by
   configure:

 sed -i 's/-lsystemd/-lelogind/' driver/Makefile.in

   Install XScreenSaver by running the following commands:

 ./configure --prefix=/usr &&
 make

   This package does not come with a test suite.

   Now, as the root user:

 make install

  Command Explanations

   --with-setuid-hacks: This switch allows some demos to be installed setuid
   root which is needed in order to ping other hosts.

  Configuring XScreenSaver

    Config Files

   /etc/X11/app-defaults/XScreenSaver and ~/.xscreensaver

    Linux PAM Configuration

   If XScreenSaver has been built with Linux PAM support, you need to create
   a PAM configuration file, to get it working correctly with BLFS.

   Issue the following commands as the root user to create the configuration
   file for Linux PAM:

 cat > /etc/pam.d/xscreensaver << "EOF"

                              Part XII. Multimedia

Chapter 42. Multimedia Libraries and Drivers

   Many multimedia programs require libraries and/or drivers in order to
   function properly. The packages in this section fall into this category.
   Generally you only need to install these if you are installing a program
   which has the library listed as either a requirement, or as an option to
   enable it to support certain functionality.

ALSA-1.1.9

   The Linux kernel now provides ALSA support by default. However,
   applications need to interface to that capability. The following six
   sections of the book deal with the separate components of ALSA: the
   libraries, the plugins, the utilities, the tools, the firmware and the OSS
   compatibility libraries.

  Kernel Configuration

   If needed, enable the following options in the kernel configuration and
   recompile the kernel:

 Device Drivers --->
   <*/m> Sound card support --->                  [CONFIG_SOUND]
     <*/m> Advanced Linux Sound Architecture ---> [CONFIG_SND]
             Select settings and drivers appropriate for your hardware.

   In the Device Drivers â Sound card support â Advanced Linux Sound
   Architecture section of the kernel configuration, select the settings and
   drivers appropriate for your hardware. Ensure that the deprecated Device
   Drivers â Sound card support â Open Sound System is not selected. If
   necessary, recompile and install your new kernel.

  Installation of ALSA Library

   Install ALSA Library by running the following commands:

 ./configure &&
 make

   If you have Doxygen installed and you wish to build the library API
   documentation, run the following commands from the top-level directory of
   the source tree:

 make doc

   To test the results, issue: make check.

   Now, as the root user:

 make install

   To install the API documentation, run the following command as the root
   user:

   User Notes: http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/alsa-utils

  Installation of ALSA Utilities

   Install ALSA Utilities by running the following commands:

 ./configure --disable-alsaconf \
             --disable-bat   \
             --disable-xmlto \
             --with-curses=ncursesw &&
 make

   This package does not come with a test suite.

   Now, as the root user:

 make install

  Command Explanations

   --disable-alsaconf: This switch disables building the alsaconf
   configuration tool which is incompatible with Udev.

   --disable-xmlto: Omit this switch if you have installed xmlto-0.0.28 and
   wish to regenerate the man pages.

   --disable-bat: Omit this switch if you have installed fftw-3.3.8 and wish
   to install the Basic Audio Tester (BAT).

   --with-curses=ncursesw: This switch forces the use of wide-character
   ncurses libraries.

  Configuring ALSA Utilities

    Config Files

   /var/lib/alsa/asound.state

    Configuration Information

   Note that all channels of your sound card are muted by default. You can
   use the alsamixer program to change this. Use speaker-test to check that
   your settings have been applied correctly. You should hear âpink noiseâ on
   your speakers.

   The alsactl program is normally run from a standard udev rule. The first
   time it is run, it will complain that there is no state in
   /var/lib/alsa/asound.state. You can prevent this by running the following
   commands as the root user:

 alsactl -L store

   The volume settings should be restored from the saved state by Udev when
   the device is detected (during boot or when plugged in for USB devices).

   All sound devices are not accessible for any user except root and members
   of the audio group. Add any users that might use the sound devices to that
   group:

 usermod -a -G audio <username>

  Note

   You may need to log out and back in again to refresh your group
   memberships. 'su <username>' should work as well.

    Boot Script

   To automatically store and restore volume settings (if udev rule doesn't
   work for you) when the system is rebooted, install the
   /etc/rc.d/init.d/alsa boot script from the blfs-bootscripts-20190609
   package.

      Optional

   GTK+-2.24.32 (to build echomixer, envy24control and rmedigicontrol),
   GTK+-3.24.10 (to build hdajackretask) and FLTK-1.3.5 (to build hdspconf
   and hdspmixer)

   User Notes: http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/alsa-tools

  Installation of ALSA Tools

  Note

   When installing multiple packages in a script, the installation needs to
   be done as the root user. There are three general options that can be used
   to do this:

    1. Run the entire script as the root user (not recommended).

    2. Use the sudo command from the Sudo-1.8.27 package.

    3. Use su -c "command arguments" (quotes required) which will ask for the
       root password for every iteration of the loop.

   One way to handle this situation is to create a short bash function that
   automatically selects the appropriate method. Once the command is set in
   the environment, it does not need to be set again.

 as_root()
 {
   if   [ $EUID = 0 ];        then $*
   elif [ -x /usr/bin/sudo ]; then sudo $*
   else                            su -c \\"$*\\"
   fi
 }

 export -f as_root

   First, start a subshell that will exit on error:

 bash -e

   Now, remove a tool that needs Qt2 or 3 and two unneed files (for the BLFS
   instructions below):

 rm -rf qlo10k1 Makefile gitcompile

   The ALSA Tools package is only needed by those with advanced requirements
   for their sound card. The tools can be built all together at once, but if
   only a subset is needed, you need to cd into the directory of each tool
   you wish to compile and run the commands. Here, we present instructions to
   build all tools.

   Install all ALSA Tools by running the following commands:

 for tool in *
 do
   case $tool in
     seq )
       tool_dir=seq/sbiload
     ;;
     * )
       tool_dir=$tool
     ;;
   esac

   pushd $tool_dir
     ./configure --prefix=/usr
     make
     as_root make install
     as_root /sbin/ldconfig
   popd

 done
 unset tool tool_dir

   Finally, exit the shell that was started earlier:

 exit

FAAC-1.29.9.2

  Introduction to FAAC

   FAAC is an encoder for a lossy sound compression scheme specified in
   MPEG-2 Part 7 and MPEG-4 Part 3 standards and known as Advanced Audio
   Coding (AAC). This encoder is useful for producing files that can be
   played back on iPod. Moreover, iPod does not understand other sound
   compression schemes in video files.

   This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS-9.0
   platform.

    Package Information

     * Download (HTTP):
       https://downloads.sourceforge.net/faac/faac-1.29.9.2.tar.gz

     * Download MD5 sum: 2b58d621fad8fda879f07b7cad8bfe10

     * Download size: 476 KB

     * Estimated disk space required: 3.2 MB

     * Estimated build time: less than 0.1 SBU

   User Notes: http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/faac

  Installation of FAAC

   Install FAAC by running the following commands:

 ./configure --prefix=/usr --disable-static &&
 make

   This package does not come with a test suite. However, basic functionality
   can be tested by encoding a sample WAV file (the sample file is installed
   by the alsa-utils-1.1.9 package:

 ./frontend/faac -o Front_Left.mp4 /usr/share/sounds/alsa/Front_Left.wav

   Then, decode the result using the faad program from the FAAD2-2.8.8
   package and play back the decoded file (requires the aplay program from
   the alsa-utils-1.1.9 package:

 faad Front_Left.mp4
 aplay Front_Left.wav

   aplay should identify the file as âSigned 16 bit Little Endian, Rate 48000
   Hz, Stereoâ, and you should hear the words âfront leftâ.

   Now, as the root user:

 make install

  Command Explanations

   --disable-static: This switch prevents installation of static versions of
   the libraries.

  Other AAC encoders

   The quality of FAAC is not up to par with the best AAC encoders currently
   available. Also, it only supports AAC and not High Efficiency AAC (also
   known as aacPlus), which provides better quality at low bitrates by means
   of using the âspectral band replicationâ technology. There are the
   following alternative programs for producing AAC and HE-AAC streams:

     * Nero AAC Codec: available only in the binary form, the command-line
       AAC and HE-AAC encoders for Linux are in the same archive as the
       Windows application.

     * 3GPP Enhanced aacPlus general audio codec: available in the source
       form, can encode only HE-AAC up to 48 kbps out of the box, but the
       maximum bitrate can be changed by editing the tuning table in the
       FloatFR_sbrenclib/src/sbr_main.c file.

   Note, however, that iPod supports only Low Complexity AAC profile, which
   is the default in FAAC, but may not be the default in Nero AAC Encoder and
   is completely unavailable in the 3GPP encoder.

gstreamer-1.16.0

  Introduction to gstreamer

   gstreamer is a streaming media framework that enables applications to
   share a common set of plugins for things like video encoding and decoding,
   audio encoding and decoding, audio and video filters, audio visualisation,
   web streaming and anything else that streams in real-time or otherwise.
   This package only provides base functionality and libraries. You may need
   at least gst-plugins-base-1.16.0 and one of Good, Bad, Ugly or Libav
   plugins.

   This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS-9.0
   platform.

    Package Information

    gstreamer Dependencies

      Required

   GLib-2.60.6

      Recommended

   gobject-introspection-1.60.2

      Optional

   GTK+-3.24.10 (for examples), Gsl-2.6, GTK-Doc-1.32, Valgrind-3.15.0, and
   libunwind

   User Notes: http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/gstreamer10

  Installation of gstreamer

  Note

   If you do not have an Objective-C compiler installed, the build system for
   this package will emit a warning about a failed sanity check. This is
   harmless, and it is safe to continue.

   At first, fix a problem causing memory leaking and spurious warnings:

 patch -Np1 -i ../gstreamer-1.16.0-buffer_size_reset_fix-1.patch

   Install gstreamer by running the following commands:

 mkdir build &&
 cd    build &&

 meson  --prefix=/usr       \
        -Dbuildtype=release \
        -Dgst_debug=false   \
        -Dgtk_doc=disabled  \
        -Dpackage-origin=http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/svn/ \
        -Dpackage-name="GStreamer 1.16.0 BLFS" &&
 ninja

   To test the results, issue: ninja test. One test, gst_gstdatetime, is
   known to fail.

  Caution

   If you are reinstalling gstreamer from a previous version, it is best if
   you remove the prior version, including plugins, before installing the new
   version. If there is a mixture of versions installed, using processes may
   hang or not work properly. As the root user:

 rm -rf /usr/bin/gst-* /usr/{lib,libexec}/gstreamer-1.0

   Now, as the root user:

 ninja install

  Contents

   Installed Programs: gst-inspect-1.0, gst-launch-1.0, gst-stats-1.0, and
   gst-typefind-1.0
   Installed Libraries: libgstbase-1.0.so, libgstcheck-1.0.so,
   libgstcontroller-1.0.so, libgstnet-1.0.so, and libgstreamer-1.0.so

   /usr/share/gtk-doc/html/gstreamer{,-libs,-plugins}-1.0

    Short Descriptions

   gst-inspect-1.0         is a tool that prints out information on available 
                           gstreamer plugins, information about a particular  
                           plugin, or information about a particular element. 
   gst-launch-1.0          is a tool that builds and runs basic gstreamer     
                           pipelines.                                         
   gst-stats-1.0           is a tool used to gather statistics about          
                           gstreamer operations.                              
   gst-typefind-1.0        uses the gstreamer type finding system to          
                           determine the relevant gstreamer plugin to parse   
                           or decode files, and the corresponding MIME type.  
   libgstbase-1.0.so       provides some base classes to be extended by       
                           elements and utillity classes that are most useful 
                           for plugin developers.                             
   libgstcheck-1.0.so      provides functionality for writing unit tests that 
                           use the check framework.                           
   libgstcontroller-1.0.so provides functionality to animate element          
                           properties over time.                              
   libgstnet-1.0.so        provides network elements and objects.             
   libgstreamer-1.0.so     provides all of the core gstreamer services,       
                           including initialization, plugin management and    
                           types, as well as the object hierarchy that        
                           defines elements and bins, along with some more    
                           specialized elements.

  Installation of GStreamer Base Plug-ins

  Note

   If you do not have an Objective-C compiler installed, the build system for
   this package will emit a warning about a failed sanity check. This is
   harmless, and it is safe to continue.

  Note

   If you need a plugin for a given dependency, that dependency needs to be
   installed before this package.

   Install GStreamer Base Plug-ins by running the following commands:

 mkdir build &&
 cd    build &&

 meson  --prefix=/usr       \
        -Dbuildtype=release \

   To test the results, issue: ninja test. The tests require an X terminal
   running, or all of the GL tests will fail.

  Note

   When installing, the Makefile does some additional linking. If you do not
   have Xorg in /usr, the LIBRARY_PATH variable needs to be defined for the
   root user. If using sudo to assume root, use the -E option to pass your
   current environment variables for the install process.

  Command Explanations

   CFLAGS="-g -O2 ...: This sets CFLAGS to -g -O2 (which is the default) but
   then on x86_64 adds -fPIC. This is needed to compile liba52 on x86_64.

   --disable-static: This switch prevents installation of static versions of
   the libraries.

   cp liba52/a52_internal.h ...: Copying this header file into

PulseAudio-12.2

  Introduction to PulseAudio

   PulseAudio is a sound system for POSIX OSes, meaning that it is a proxy
   for sound applications. It allows you to do advanced operations on your
   sound data as it passes between your application and your hardware. Things
   like transferring the audio to a different machine, changing the sample
   format or channel count and mixing several sounds into one are easily
   achieved using a sound server.

   This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS-9.0
   platform.

      Required

   libsndfile-1.0.28

      Recommended

   alsa-lib-1.1.9, dbus-1.12.16, elogind-241.3, GLib-2.60.6, libcap-2.27 with

   libasyncns, LIRC, ORC, soxr, TDB, WebRTC AudioProcessing and XEN

   User Notes: http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/pulseaudio

  Installation of PulseAudio

   Install PulseAudio by running the following commands:

   First, adapt Pulseaudio to upstream ALSA API changes:

 sed -i "s:asoundlib.h:alsa/asoundlib.h:" src/modules/alsa/*.{c,h} &&
 sed -i "s:use-case.h:alsa/use-case.h:" configure.ac &&
 sed -i "s:use-case.h:alsa/use-case.h:" src/modules/alsa/alsa-ucm.h

 NOCONFIGURE=1 ./bootstrap.sh     &&
 ./configure --prefix=/usr                \
             --sysconfdir=/etc            \
             --localstatedir=/var         \
             --disable-bluez4             \
             --disable-bluez5             \
             --disable-rpath              \
             --with-systemduserunitdir=no &&
 make

   To test the results, issue: make check. The volume-test may fail for
   unknown reasons.

   Now, as the root user:

 make install

   While still as the root user, remove the D-Bus configuration file for the
   system wide daemon to avoid creating unnecessary system users and groups:

 rm -fv /etc/dbus-1/system.d/pulseaudio-system.conf

  Command Explanations

   --disable-bluez4: This switch disables support for BlueZ version 4 in
   favour of BlueZ version 5 since the latter also installs compatibility
   library for the earlier version.

   --disable-bluez5: This switch prevents a runtime error if dbus-1.12.16 and
   SBC-1.4 are both installed but BlueZ-5.50 is not installed. Remove this if
   you have installed all three packages.

   --disable-rpath: This switch prevents linker from adding a hardcoded
   runtime path to the installed programs and libraries.

  Configuring PulseAudio

    Config Files

   There are system wide configuration files: /etc/pulse/daemon.conf,
   /etc/pulse/client.conf, /etc/pulse/default.pa, and user configuration
   files with the same names in ~/.config/pulse. User configuration files
   take precedence over system wide ones.

    Configuration Information

   The default configuration files allow setting up a working installation.
   However, a reference to Console-Kit needs to be removed. Issue the
   following command as the root user:

 sed -i '/load-module module-console-kit/s/^/#/' /etc/pulse/default.pa

   You may also have to configure the audio system. You can start pulseaudio
   in command line mode using pulseaudio -C and then list various information
   and change settings. See man pulse-cli-syntax.

   If pulseaudio was working but you no-longer have sound, after checking for
   hardware issues (speakers or headphones not connected, external amplifier
   not connected) you may need to fix it.

   One suggestion is to close the application, such as firefox where sound
   has stopped working, then run: pactl list short sinks followed by: pacmd
   set-default-sink <sink #> and then restart the application.

   If that does not work, a more drastic approach often works. After closing
   the application, close pulseaudio, either using pulseaudio --kill or, if
   that fails, killall -KILL pulseaudio and then rm -rf ~/.config/pulse/*
   (and perhaps also rm -rf ~/.pulse/* if you have used a very old version of
   pulse on this machine, then run pulseaudio --verbose to restart it. If the
   daemon starts, restart the application. See man pulseaudio for more
   options.

   User Notes: http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/sdl

  Installation of SDL

   Install SDL by running the following commands:

 sed -e '/_XData32/s:register long:register _Xconst long:' \
     -i src/video/x11/SDL_x11sym.h &&

 ./configure --prefix=/usr --disable-static &&

 make

   Now, as the root user:

 make install &&

 install -v -m755 -d /usr/share/doc/SDL-1.2.15/html &&
 install -v -m644    docs/html/*.html \
                     /usr/share/doc/SDL-1.2.15/html

  Testing SDL

   If you wish to, test the installation of SDL using the included test
   programs. It is not required to install any of the resulting binaries to
   validate the installation. Issue the following commands to build the test
   programs:

 cd test &&
 ./configure &&
 make

   You'll need to manually run all the test programs (they are listed in the
   README file in this directory). Many of them will need to be manually
   killed, and you'll need to turn your speakers on with the volume at a
   suitable level.

  Command Explanations

   sed -e ...: This command fixes compilation with libX11-1.6.0 and later.

   --disable-static: This switch prevents installation of static versions of
   the libraries.

   --disable-alsa-shared: This switch disables dynamically loading ALSA
   shared libraries.

   --disable-sdl-dlopen: This switch disables using dlopen for shared object
   loading. Loading image backend libraries like libpng dynamically on the
   fly does not work.

   --disable-x11-shared: This switch disables dynamically loading X11 shared
   libraries.

  Configuring SDL

    Configuration Information

   As with most libraries, there is no configuration to do, save that the
   library directory, i.e., /opt/lib or /usr/local/lib should appear in
   /etc/ld.so.conf so that ldd can find the shared libraries. After checking
   that this is the case, /sbin/ldconfig should be run while logged in as
   root.

  Contents

   Installed Program: sdl-config
   Installed Libraries: libSDL.so and libSDLmain.a
   Installed Directories: /usr/include/SDL and /usr/share/doc/SDL-1.2.15

    Short Descriptions

   sdl-config determines the compile and linker flags that should be used to  
              compile and link programs that use libSDL.                      
   libSDL.so  library provides low level access to audio, keyboard, mouse,    
              joystick, 3D hardware via OpenGL, and 2D frame buffer across    
              multiple platforms.

 popd

  Note

   If you wish to build and run the package regression tests, do not delete
   the static libraries below until after the tests are built.

   Now, as the root user:

 make install              &&
 rm -v /usr/lib/libSDL2*.a

   If you built the documentation, install it as the root user:

 install -v -m755 -d        /usr/share/doc/SDL2-2.0.10/html &&
 cp -Rv  docs/output/html/* /usr/share/doc/SDL2-2.0.10/html

  Command Explanations

   rm -v /usr/lib/libSDL2*.a: Normally static libraries can be disabled with
   a --disable-static option to configure, but that breaks the build in this
   package.

   --disable-alsa-shared: This switch disables dynamically loading ALSA
   shared libraries.

   --disable-sdl-dlopen: This switch disables using dlopen for shared object
   loading. Loading image backend libraries like libpng dynamically on the

   To create the API documentation, Doxygen must be installed and issue the
   following command:

 doxygen doc/Doxyfile

   This package does not come with a test suite.

   Now, as the root user:

 make install

  Note

   When installing, the Makefile does some additional linking. If you do not
   have Xorg in /usr, the LIBRARY_PATH variable needs to be defined for the
   root user. If using sudo to assume root, use the -E option to pass your
   current environment variables for the install process.

   If you built the API documentation, issue the following commands as the
   root user to install it:

 install -v -m755 -d /usr/share/doc/xine-lib-1.2.9/api &&
 install -v -m644    doc/api/* \
                     /usr/share/doc/xine-lib-1.2.9/api

  Command Explanations

   sed ...: These commands enable the package to be built with
   ImageMagick-7.0.8-60 and libxcb-1.13.1.

   --disable-vcd: This switch is required to compile Xine Lib without
   VCDImager installed. Remove this option if you have installed VCDImager.

   --with-external-dvdnav: This switch is required, because internal
   libraries cannot decrypt DVD.

   --docdir=/usr/share/doc/xine-lib-1.2.9: This switch causes the
   documentation to be installed into a versioned directory instead of the
   default /usr/share/doc/xine-lib.

   --disable-vaapi: use this switch if libva-2.5.0 is installed and GLU-9.0.1
   is not, to prevent a build failure.

   User Notes: http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/audacious

  Installation of Audacious

    Installation of the Main Audacious Program

   Install Audacious by running the following commands (you may wish to
   change the stamp to another string):

 TPUT=/bin/true ./configure --prefix=/usr \
                            --with-buildstamp="BLFS" &&
 make

   This package does not come with a test suite.

   Now, as the root user:

 make install

    Installation of Audacious Plugins

   Install the required plugins package by issuing the following commands:

 tar -xf ../audacious-plugins-3.10.1.tar.bz2                &&
 cd audacious-plugins-3.10.1                                &&
 TPUT=/bin/true ./configure --prefix=/usr --disable-wavpack &&
 make

   Now, as the root user:

 make install

  Note

   This package installs icon files into the /usr/share/icons/hicolor
   hierarchy and desktop files into the /usr/share/applications hierarchy.
   You can improve system performance and memory usage by updating
   /usr/share/icons/hicolor/index.theme and
   /usr/share/applications/mimeinfo.cache. To perform the update you must
   have GTK+-2.24.32 or GTK+-3.24.10 installed (for the icon cache) and
   desktop-file-utils-0.24 (for the desktop cache) and issue the following
   commands as the root user:

 gtk-update-icon-cache -qtf /usr/share/icons/hicolor &&
 update-desktop-database -q

  Command Explanations

   TPUT=/bin/true: the default is for make to output text in color. This is
   fine if you are building in a terminal, but if you script the build
   process and pipe the output from make to a log file then the control
   characters used to color the text can make the logfile unreadable. This
   option stops it coloring the text.

   --with-buildstamp: This switch appends the given text to the version
   string.

   --disable-wavpack: This switch is required unless the optional WavPack
   package is installed.

   --disable-gtk: Use this to disable GTK+ support.

   --disable-mp3: Use this for the plugins if you have not installed mpg123
   and do not wish to play mp3 files.

   --enable-qt: Use this to enable Qt support.

   --enable-valgrind: Allow better Valgrind leak checks.

   --disable-neon: Use this for the plugins if you have not installed neon,
   and do not want to use HTTP/HTTPS transport.

  Configuring Audacious

   If you prefer the old, smaller Winamp/XMMS interface, click on View>
   Interface> Winamp Classic Interface.

   If you built with both Gtk and Qt user interfaces, the Qt version can be
   executed from a terminal, issuing audacious --qt. If you wish a desktop
   menu entry to execute this Qt version, issue the following commands as the
   root user:

 cp -v /usr/share/applications/audacious{,-qt}.desktop &&

 sed -e '/^Name/ s/$/ Qt/' \
     -e '/Exec=/ s/audacious/& --qt/' \
     -i /usr/share/applications/audacious-qt.desktop

  Contents

   Installed Programs: audacious and audtool
   Installed Libraries: libaudcore.so, libaudgui.so, libaudqt.so,

Chapter 44. Video Utilities

   This chapter always seems to be the favorite chapter. It's probably
   because there is a lot of satisfaction in playing your first video when
   you have spent so much time getting to that point. All those libraries,
   all the configurations and your reward is that you finally get to watch a
   movie. Not to worry though, there is always one more CODEC to install.

FFmpeg-4.2

  Introduction to FFmpeg

   FFmpeg is a solution to record, convert and stream audio and video. It is
   a very fast video and audio converter and it can also acquire from a live
   audio/video source. Designed to be intuitive, the command-line interface
   (ffmpeg) tries to figure out all the parameters, when possible. FFmpeg can
   also convert from any sample rate to any other, and resize video on the
   fly with a high quality polyphase filter. FFmpeg can use a Video4Linux
   compatible video source and any Open Sound System audio source.

   This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS-9.0
   platform.

             --docdir=/usr/share/doc/ffmpeg-4.2 &&

 make &&

 gcc tools/qt-faststart.c -o tools/qt-faststart

   HTML documentation was built in the previous step. If you have
   texlive-20190410 installed and wish to build PDF and Postscript versions
   of the documentation, issue the following commands:

 pushd doc &&
 for DOCNAME in `basename -s .html *.html`
 do
     texi2pdf -b $DOCNAME.texi &&
     texi2dvi -b $DOCNAME.texi &&

     dvips    -o $DOCNAME.ps   \
                 $DOCNAME.dvi
 done &&
 popd &&
 unset DOCNAME

   If you have Doxygen-1.8.16 installed and you wish to build (if
   --disable-doc was used) or rebuild the html documentation, issue:

 doxygen doc/Doxyfile

   The fate-suite tests include comparisons with installed files, and should
   not be run before the package is installed. Therefore, if you desire to
   run them, instructions are given further below.

   Now, as the root user:

 make install &&

 install -v -m755    tools/qt-faststart /usr/bin &&
 install -v -m755 -d           /usr/share/doc/ffmpeg-4.2 &&
 install -v -m644    doc/*.txt /usr/share/doc/ffmpeg-4.2

   If the PDF and Postscript documentation was built, issue the following
   commands, as the root user, to install them:

 install -v -m644 doc/*.pdf /usr/share/doc/ffmpeg-4.2 &&
 install -v -m644 doc/*.ps  /usr/share/doc/ffmpeg-4.2

   If you used doxygen to manually create the API documentation, install it
   by issuing the following commands as the root user:

 install -v -m755 -d /usr/share/doc/ffmpeg-4.2/api                     &&
 cp -vr doc/doxy/html/* /usr/share/doc/ffmpeg-4.2/api                  &&
 find /usr/share/doc/ffmpeg-4.2/api -type f -exec chmod -c 0644 \{} \; &&
 find /usr/share/doc/ffmpeg-4.2/api -type d -exec chmod -c 0755 \{} \;

   To properly test the installation you must have rsync-3.1.3 installed and
   follow the instructions for the FFmpeg Automated Testing Environment
   (FATE). First, about 1 GB of sample files used to run FATE are downloaded
   with the command:

 make fate-rsync SAMPLES=fate-suite/

   The fate-suite directory is created and the files are downloaded there.
   That command actually runs an rsync command, to obtain the sample files.
   You may want to compress and keep this directory for testing again, in
   another system, or when a new version of ffmpeg is launched. Then, you
   unpack the sample files in the source directory, and run, again, the make
   fate-rsync ... command above, to sync with the repository. Now, the
   download size and time are drastically reduced. Estimated values in
   "Package Information" do not include the download SBU. Some samples may
   have been removed, in the new version, so, in order to be sure local and
   server fate samples are identical, when you use previously saved samples,
   run the following command:

 rsync -vrltLW  --delete --timeout=60 --contimeout=60 \
       rsync://fate-suite.ffmpeg.org/fate-suite/ fate-suite/

   Next, FATE is executed, with the commands (you obtain a number of tests
   larger than 3000):

 make fate THREADS=N SAMPLES=fate-suite/ | tee ../fate.log &&
 grep ^TEST ../fate.log | wc -l

   where N is an integer, N â¤ number of cores in the system.

  Command Explanations

   sed -i ... configure: This command adds the ALSA library to the Flite
   LDFLAGS variable and enables the discovery of Flite.

   --enable-gpl: Enables the use of GPL code and permits support for
   postprocessing, swscale and many other features.

   --enable-version3: Enables the use of (L)GPL version 3 code.

   --enable-nonfree: Enables the use of nonfree code. Note that the resulting
   libraries and binaries will be unredistributable.

   --disable-static: This switch prevents installation of static versions of
   the libraries.

   --enable-shared: Enables building shared libraries, otherwise only static
   libraries are built and installed.

   --disable-debug: Disables building debugging symbols into the programs and
   libraries.

   --enable-avresample: Enables Transcode-1.1.7 to be compiled.

   --enable-libass: Enables ASS/SSA subtitle format rendering via libass.

   --enable-libfdk-aac: Enables currently the highest-quality AAC audio
   encoding via libfdk-aac.

   libx264.

   --enable-libx265: Enables high-quality H.265/HEVC encoding via libx265.

   --enable-openssl or --enable-gnutls: Enables HTTPS protocol for network
   streams.

   --disable-doc: Disables building html documentation. This is only needed
   if Doxygen-1.8.16 is installed and you do not want to build the html
   documentation.

   --enable-libpulse: Enables support for Pulseaudio for audio output.

   gcc tools/qt-faststart.c -o tools/qt-faststart: This builds the
   qt-faststart program which can modify QuickTime formatted movies (.mov or
   .mp4) so that the header information is located at the beginning of the
   file instead of the end. This allows the movie file to begin playing
   before the entire file has been downloaded.

  Note

   Support for most of the dependency packages requires using options passed
   to the configure script. View the output from ./configure --help for
   complete information about enabling dependency packages.

   User Notes: http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/mplayer

  Installation of MPlayer

    Main MPlayer Installation

  Note

   The package maintainers recommend building without any optimizations.

   You may wish to examine the output from ./configure --help to find out
   what additional parameters to configure are needed to include the
   dependencies you have installed on your system.

   Install MPlayer by running the following commands:

 ./configure --prefix=/usr            \
             --confdir=/etc/mplayer   \
             --enable-dynamic-plugins \
             --enable-menu            \
             --enable-gui             &&
 make

   If you wish to build the HTML documentation, issue the following command:

 make doc

   This package does not come with a test suite.

   Now, as the root user:

 make install  &&
 ln -svf ../icons/hicolor/48x48/apps/mplayer.png \
         /usr/share/pixmaps/mplayer.png

   To install the HTML documentation, issue the following commands as the
   root user:

 install -v -m755 -d /usr/share/doc/mplayer-1.4 &&
 install -v -m644    DOCS/HTML/en/* \
                     /usr/share/doc/mplayer-1.4

   You will only need codecs.conf if you want to change its properties, as
   the main binary contains an internal copy of it. Ensure any changes you
   make to codecs.conf achieve the desired results, as incorrect entries in
   this file have been known to cause errors and render the player unusable.
   If necessary, create the file as the root user:

 install -v -m644 etc/codecs.conf /etc/mplayer

   You may alternatively want to copy all the default configuration files to
   /etc/mplayer for future reference or more customization ability. As the
   root user:

 install -v -m644 etc/*.conf /etc/mplayer

    Skin Installation (Optional)

   To enable the Gtk+ 2 frontend of MPlayer, you'll need to install at least
   one skin. Extract the desired skin and create the default location (as the
   root user):

 tar -xvf  ../Clearlooks-2.0.tar.bz2 \
     -C    /usr/share/mplayer/skins &&
 ln  -sfvn Clearlooks /usr/share/mplayer/skins/default

  Note

   This package installs icon files into the /usr/share/icons/hicolor
   hierarchy and desktop files into the /usr/share/applications hierarchy.
   You can improve system performance and memory usage by updating
   /usr/share/icons/hicolor/index.theme and
   /usr/share/applications/mimeinfo.cache. To perform the update you must
   have GTK+-2.24.32 or GTK+-3.24.10 installed (for the icon cache) and
   desktop-file-utils-0.24 (for the desktop cache) and issue the following
   commands as the root user:

 gtk-update-icon-cache -qtf /usr/share/icons/hicolor &&
 update-desktop-database -q

  Command Explanations

   --enable-gui: This option builds the GUI interface into mplayer.

   --enable-menu: This option is set to enable the on-screen display.

   --language-doc="<lang>": This switch enables the language used for the
   documentation. Use ./configure --help to find out what additional
   information.

   --language-man="<lang>": This switch enables the language used for the man
   pages. Use ./configure --help to find out what additional information.

   --language-msg="<lang>": This switch enables the language used for the
   messages and the GUI. Use ./configure --help to find out what additional
   information.

   --language="<lang>": This switch defines the default language used. Use
   ./configure --help to find out what additional information.

  Note

   Specific options override --language. You can pass a list of languages
   separated by whitespace or commas instead of a single language.
   Nonexisting translations will be dropped from each list. All documentation
   and man page translations available in the list will be installed, for the
   messages the first available translation will be used. The value "all"
   will activate all translations. The LINGUAS environment variable is
   honored. In all cases the fallback is English. Values listed by
   ./configure --help are not all available, as would normally be expected.
   You need to build test.

  Configuring MPlayer

    Config Files

   /etc/mplayer/* and ~/.mplayer/*

  Note

   To play a DVD, it may be useful to ensure a /dev/dvd device is created.
   You may need to set this up as described in the section called âDevices
   for DVD Drivesâ.

    Configuration Information

   Typically, there's no configuration required for the system-wide files in
   /etc/mplayer (in fact, this directory is empty unless you copied the
   default files as mentioned above). Configuration can be accomplished by
   choosing the configuration button located on the MPlayer GUI. Any
   configuration changes made in the GUI will be saved in the user's
   ~/.mplayer directory.

Transcode-1.1.7

  Introduction to Transcode

   Transcode was a fast, versatile and command-line based audio/video
   everything to everything converter primarily focussed on producing AVI
   video files with MP3 audio, but also including a program to read all the
   video and audio streams from a DVD.

   Although outdated and no longer maintained, it can still be used to
   extract items from a DVD using only the required and recommended
   dependencies, or to recode to AVI files.

   Subjects to the comments below, this package is known to build and
   minimally work using an LFS-8.3 platform.

   This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS-9.0
   platform.

   User Notes: http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/transcode

  Installation of Transcode

  Note

   The details of how the FFmpeg libraries are used has changed since this
   version of Transcode was released. The patch allows the package to be
   compiled, but some or all of the internal calls to FFmpeg may fail at run
   time (they report an error and processing continues, but without any
   output).

   For many packages, that would be a critical error. In this case, the main
   reason to install Transcode is for the tccat program, which works. Some of
   the transcode options work - for the others, use ffmpeg directly on the
   command line.

  Note

   Support for most of the dependency packages requires using options passed
   to the configure script. View the INSTALL file and the output from
   ./configure --help for complete information about enabling dependency
   packages.

   Install Transcode by running the following commands:

 sed -i 's|doc/transcode|&-$(PACKAGE_VERSION)|' \
        $(find . -name Makefile.in -exec grep -l 'docsdir =' {} \;) &&

 patch -Np1 -i ../transcode-1.1.7-ffmpeg4-1.patch                   &&
 ./configure --prefix=/usr \
             --enable-alsa \
             --enable-libmpeg2 &&
 make

   This package does not come with a test suite.

   Now, as the root user:

 make install

  Command Explanations

   sed -i ...: Fixes install location for documentation.

  Contents

   Installed Programs: avifix, aviindex, avimerge, avisplit, avisync, tccat,
   tcdecode, tcdemux, tcextract, tcmodinfo, tcmp3cut, tcprobe, tcscan,
   tcxmlcheck, tcxpm2rgb, tcyait, and transcode
   Installed Libraries: None
   Installed Directories: /usr/lib/transcode and
   /usr/share/doc/transcode-1.1.7

    Short Descriptions

   avifix     fixes the header of an AVI file.                                
   aviindex   writes a text file describing the index of an AVI file.         
   avimerge   merges AVI files of the same format. Do not try to merge AVI    
              files of different formats, it will most likely result in       
              errors (and format means same bitrates, too!).                  
   avisplit   splits AVI files into multiple files.                           
   avisync    can shift audio in AVI files for better synchronizing of the    
              audio and video data signal.                                    
   tccat      concatenates input files using the input plugins of Transcode.  
              This is useful for extracting VOB (Video OBject) files, either  
              for a whole DVD or for selected Titles or Chapters, which can   
              then be played or recoded.                                      
   tcdecode   is used to decode input files to raw video and PCM audio        
              streams.                                                        
   tcdemux    demultiplexes (separates) audio/video input that contains       
              multiple streams, e.g., VOB files.                              
   tcextract  grabs single streams from a file containing multiple streams.   
   tcmodinfo  loads a supplied Transcode filter module and prints its         
              parameters.                                                     
   tcmp3cut   is a tool which can cut MP3 streams at milliseconds positions.  
   tcprobe    prints information about the input file format.                 
   tcscan     performs several measurements on the given input data.          
   tcxmlcheck checks information in a SMIL input file.                        
   transcode  is the encoder's user interface that handles the plugins and    
              other programs, being the glue between the modules. There are   
              several well documented usage examples on both the homepage and 
              the documentation included in the package.

VLC-3.0.8

  Introduction to VLC

   VLC is a media player, streamer, and encoder. It can play from many
   inputs, such as files, network streams, capture devices, desktops, or DVD,
   SVCD, VCD, and audio CD. It can use most audio and video codecs (MPEG
   1/2/4, H264, VC-1, DivX, WMV, Vorbis, AC3, AAC, etc.), and it can also
   convert to different formats and/or send streams through the network.

xine-ui-0.99.10

  Introduction to Xine User Interface

   The xine User Interface package contains a multimedia player. It plays
   back CDs, DVDs and VCDs. It also decodes multimedia files like AVI, MOV,
   WMV, MPEG and MP3 from local disk drives, and displays multimedia streamed
   over the Internet.

   This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS-9.0
   platform.

  Note

   Although this version of xine-ui works with most files, it is unable to
   open encrypted (content-scrambled) DVDs with the current version of
   libdvdcss.

  Kernel Configuration

  Note

   There used to be a conflict between the Cups libusb backend and the usblp
   kernel driver. This is no longer the case and cups will work with both of
   these enabled.

   If you want to use the kernel usblp driver (for example, if you wish to
   use escputil from Gutenprint-5.3.3) enable the following options in your
   kernel configuration and recompile the kernel:

 Device Drivers  --->
   [*] USB support  --->                          [CONFIG_USB_SUPPORT]
     <*/M>  OHCI HCD (USB 1.1) support            [CONFIG_USB_OHCI_HCD]
     <*/M>  UHCI HCD (most Intel and VIA) support [CONFIG_USB_UHCI_HCD]
     <*/M>  USB Printer support                   [CONFIG_USB_PRINTER]

   If you have a parallel printer, enable the following options in your
   kernel configuration and recompile the kernel:

 Device Drivers  --->
   <*/M> Parallel port support  --->    [CONFIG_PARPORT]
     <*/M> PC-style hardware            [CONFIG_PARPORT_PC]
   Character devices  --->
     <*/M> Parallel printer support     [CONFIG_PRINTER]

  Installation of Cups

   You will need to add an lp user, as Cups will create some files owned by
   this user. (The lp user is the default used by Cups, but may be changed to
   a different user by passing a parameter to the configure script.) Use the
   following command as the root user:

 useradd -c "Print Service User" -d /var/spool/cups -g lp -s /bin/false -u 9 lp

   You will also need a dedicated group that will contain users allowed to do
   Cups administrative tasks. Add the group by running the following command
   as the root user:

 groupadd -g 19 lpadmin

   If you want to add a user to the Cups administrative group, run the
   following command as the root user:

 usermod -a -G lpadmin <username>

   If you didn't install xdg-utils-1.1.3, use the following sed to change the
   default browser that will be used to access the Cups web interface:

 sed -i 's#@CUPS_HTMLVIEW@#firefox#' desktop/cups.desktop.in

   Replace firefox with the web browser of your choice.

   Build Cups by running the following commands:

 sed -i 's:444:644:' Makedefs.in                                     &&
 sed -i '/MAN.EXT/s:.gz::' configure config-scripts/cups-manpages.m4 &&
 sed -i '/stat.h/a #include <asm-generic/ioctls.h>' test/ipptool.c   &&

 aclocal  -I config-scripts &&
 autoconf -I config-scripts &&

 CC=gcc CXX=g++ \
 ./configure --libdir=/usr/lib            \
             --disable-systemd            \
             --with-rcdir=/tmp/cupsinit   \
             --with-system-groups=lpadmin \
             --with-docdir=/usr/share/cups/doc-2.2.12 &&
 make

   To test the results, issue: make -k check. An already active graphical
   session with bus address is necessary to run the tests.

   Now, as the root user:

 make install &&
 rm -rf /tmp/cupsinit &&
 ln -svnf ../cups/doc-2.2.12 /usr/share/doc/cups-2.2.12

   Create a basic Cups client configuration file by running the following
   command as the root user:

 echo "ServerName /var/run/cups/cups.sock" > /etc/cups/client.conf

  Note

   This package installs icon files into the /usr/share/icons/hicolor
   hierarchy and you can improve system performance and memory usage by
   updating /usr/share/icons/hicolor/index.theme. To perform the update you
   must have GTK+-2.24.32 or GTK+-3.24.10 installed and issue the following
   command as the root user:

 gtk-update-icon-cache -qtf /usr/share/icons/hicolor

  Command Explanations

   sed ... Makedefs.in: Fix files and directories permissions.

   sed ... cups-manpages.m4: This sed prevents compression of the man pages
   by default.

   sed ... test/ipptool.c: This sed fixes a bug caused by glibc-2.30 changing
   the user-space API for sockets.

   CC=gcc CXX=g++: This environment variable ensures that gcc is used, if
   clang is installed. Remove it, if you prefer to use clang. Using clang
   almost doubles build time and slightly decreases build disk space.
   Installed disk space is not appreciably modified.

   --disable-systemd: Systemd is not supported by this version of BLFS.

   --with-rcdir=/tmp/cupsinit: This switch tells the build process to install
   the shipped bootscript into /tmp instead of /etc/rc.d.

   --with-system-groups=lpadmin: This switch ensures that only lpadmin will
   be used as the Cups administrative group.

   --disable-libusb: Use this switch if you have installed libusb-1.0.22, but
   wish to use the kernel usblp driver.

   --enable-libpaper: Use this switch if you have installed libpaper and wish
   to use it with Cups.

  Configuring Cups

    Config Files

   /etc/cups/*

    Configuration Information

   Normally, printers are set up via a web browser. The Cups server will
   normally connect via the url http://localhost:631. From there printers,
   print jobs, and the server configuration can be set up and managed. Remote
   system administration can also be set up. Configuration can also be done
   from the command line via the lpadmin, lpoptions, and lpstat commands.

   Configuration of Cups is dependent on the type of printer and can be
   complex. Generally, PostScript printers are easier. For detailed
   instructions on configuration and use of Cups, see
   http://www.cups.org/documentation.php.

   For non-PostScript printers to print with Cups, you need to install
   ghostscript-9.27 to convert PostScript to raster images and a driver (e.g.
   from Gutenprint-5.3.3) to convert the resulting raster images to a form
   that the printer understands. Foomatic drivers use ghostscript-9.27 to
   convert PostScript to a printable form directly, but this is considered
   suboptimal by Cups developers.

    Linux PAM Configuration

   If CUPS has been built with Linux PAM support, you need to create a PAM
   configuration file to get it working correctly with BLFS.

   Issue the following command as the root user to create the configuration
   file for Linux PAM:

 cat > /etc/pam.d/cups << "EOF"
 # Begin /etc/pam.d/cups

 auth    include system-auth
 account include system-account
 session include system-session

 # End /etc/pam.d/cups
 EOF

    Boot Script

   If you want the Cups print service to start automatically when the system
   is booted, install the init script included in the
   blfs-bootscripts-20190609 package:

 make install-cups

   Cups-2.2.12 (required for building the âcupsâ device backend, which is
   needed by cups-filters), Fontconfig-2.13.1 (required, if you are
   installing any suggested font), FreeType-2.10.1, libjpeg-turbo-2.0.2,
   libpng-1.6.37, LibTIFF-4.0.10, Little CMS-2.9, and OpenJPEG-2.3.1

      Optional

   Window System

   User Notes: http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/gs

  Installation of Ghostscript

  Note

   The Ghostscript build system is not user-friendly. In order to use system
   copies of various graphics libraries, you must do it using unconventional
   methods.

   GPL Ghostscript includes (old) copies of several libraries. Some of these
   seem to have been patched to fix known vulnerabilities, but others of
   these copies are less-well maintained. To ensure that any future fixes are
   applied throughout the whole system, it is recommended that you first
   install the released versions of these libraries and then configure GPL
   Ghostscript to link to them.

   If you have installed the recommended dependencies on your system, remove
   the copies of freetype, lcms2, libjpeg, libpng, and openjpeg:

 rm -rf freetype lcms2mt jpeg libpng openjpeg

   Compile Ghostscript:

 rm -rf zlib &&

 patch -Np1 -i ../ghostscript-9.27-upstream_fixes-1.patch &&

 ./configure --prefix=/usr           \
             --disable-compile-inits \
             --enable-dynamic        \
             --with-system-libtiff   &&
 make

  Note

   The shared library depends on GTK+-3.24.10. It is only used by external
   programs like asymptote-2.52, ImageMagick-7.0.8-60, and texlive-20190410.

   To compile the shared library libgs.so, run the following additional
   command as an unprivileged user:

 make so

   This package does not come with a test suite. A set of example files may
   be used for testing, but it is only possible after installation of the
   package.

   Now, as the root user:

 make install

   If you want the shared library too:

 make soinstall &&
 install -v -m644 base/*.h /usr/include/ghostscript &&
 ln -sfvn ghostscript /usr/include/ps

   Now make the documentation accessible from the normal place:

 mv -v /usr/share/doc/ghostscript/9.27 /usr/share/doc/ghostscript-9.27  &&
 rm -rfv /usr/share/doc/ghostscript &&
 cp -a examples/ /usr/share/ghostscript/9.27/

   If you have downloaded the fonts, unpack them to /usr/share/ghostscript
   and ensure the ownerships of the files are root: root.

 tar -xvf ../ghostscript-fonts-std-8.11.tar.gz -C /usr/share/ghostscript --no-same-owner &&
 tar -xvf ../gnu-gs-fonts-other-6.0.tar.gz     -C /usr/share/ghostscript --no-same-owner &&
 fc-cache -v /usr/share/ghostscript/fonts/

   You can now test the rendering of various postscript and pdf files from
   the /usr/share/ghostscript/9.27/examples , for example (you need an X
   window system display):

 gs -q -dBATCH /usr/share/ghostscript/9.27/examples/tiger.eps

  Command Explanations

   rm -rf zlib : zlib was installed as part of LFS.

   --disable-compile-inits: This option makes gs and libgs.so slightly
   smaller.

   --with-system-libtiff: Remove this option if you've not installed
   LibTIFF-4.0.10.

   install -v -m644 base/*.h... : Some packages (ImageMagick is one) need the
   Ghostscript interface headers in place to link to the shared library.
   These commands install the headers.

   ln -sfvn ghostscript /usr/include/ps: Some packages expect to find the
   interface headers in an alternate location.

   mv -v /usr/share/doc/ghostscript/9.27 /usr/share/doc/ghostscript-9.27:
   This moves the documentation where it is expected to be found.

   --disable-cups: this option will save a tiny amount of space by not
   linking gs and libgs.so to the Cups-2.2.12 libraries if you have installed
   those.

      Recommended

   Cups-2.2.12 and Gimp-2.10.12

      Recommended (at runtime)

   Two families of DyeSub photo printers each require another library at
   runtime. Unless you have one of these devices you will not want these
   libraries.

   For the Sinfonia S6145 and the Ciaat Brava 21, libS6145ImageReProcess, see
   Peachy Photos (Sinfonia) for instructions on how to build and test this.

   For the Mitsubishi D70 family and the similar Kodak 305,
   libMitsuD70ImageReProcess, see Peachy Photos (Mitsubishi CP-D70) for
   instructions on how to build and test this.

      Optional (to Regenerate Documentation)

   User Notes: http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/gutenprint

  Kernel Configuration

   If you intend to use escputil with a USB-connected Epson Stylus printer
   for commands such as --ink-level which need to access the raw device, you
   must enable the kernel's usblp driver. Enable the following options in
   your kernel configuration and recompile the kernel:

 Device Drivers  --->
   [*] USB support  --->                          [CONFIG_USB_SUPPORT]
     <*/M>  OHCI HCD (USB 1.1) support            [CONFIG_USB_OHCI_HCD]
     <*/M>  UHCI HCD (most Intel and VIA) support [CONFIG_USB_UHCI_HCD]
     <*/M>  USB Printer support                   [CONFIG_USB_PRINTER]

  Installation of Gutenprint

   Install Gutenprint by running the following commands:

 sed -i 's|$(PACKAGE)/doc|doc/$(PACKAGE)-$(VERSION)|' \
        {,doc/,doc/developer/}Makefile.in &&

 ./configure --prefix=/usr --disable-static &&

 make

   To test the results, issue: make check. The tests take a very long time
   and use a lot of disk space. When last tested (version 5.2.15 in June
   2019) this needed 75 SBU and 13.5 GB to complete the tests (one test,
   rastertogutenprint failed because the CUPS ppds are for a previous
   version. Maybe genppds should be run before the tests). Note that the
   tests used only one CPU.

   Now, as the root user:

 make install &&
 install -v -m755 -d /usr/share/doc/gutenprint-5.3.3/api/gutenprint{,ui2} &&
 install -v -m644    doc/gutenprint/html/* \
                     /usr/share/doc/gutenprint-5.3.3/api/gutenprint &&
 install -v -m644    doc/gutenprintui2/html/* \
                     /usr/share/doc/gutenprint-5.3.3/api/gutenprintui2

  Command Explanations

   sed -i '...' ...Makefile.in: This command is used so that the package
   documentation is installed in the conventional /usr/share/doc directory
   structure instead of /usr/share/gutenprint/doc.

   --disable-static: This switch prevents installation of static versions of
   the libraries.

  Configuring Gutenprint

    Configuration Information

   For CUPS to see newly installed print drivers, it has to be restarted (as
   the root user):

 /etc/rc.d/init.d/cups restart

   Then point your web browser to http://localhost:631/ to add a new printer
   to CUPS.

  Contents

   Installed Programs: cups-calibrate, cups-genppd.5.2, cups-genppdupdate,
   escputil, and testpattern
   Installed Libraries: libgutenprint.so, libgutenprintui2.so and optionally,
   various CUPS filters and backend drivers under
   /usr/lib/gutenprint/5.2/modules/
   Installed Directories: /usr/{include,lib,share}/gutenprint,
   /usr/include/gutenprintui2 and /usr/share/doc/gutenprint-5.3.3

    Short Descriptions

   cups-calibrate    calibrates the color output of printers using the        
                     Gutenprint, CUPS or ESP Print Pro drivers.               
   cups-genppd.5.2   generates Gutenprint PPD files for use with CUPS.        
   cups-genppdupdate regenerates the Gutenprint PPD files in use by CUPS.     
   escputil          is a command line utility to perform various maintenance 
                     tasks on Epson Stylus inkjet printers.                   
   testpattern       is a test program to learn how to use libgutenprint.

Chapter 47. Scanning

   This chapter contains scanning applications which allow you to convert
   printed documents into formatted documents readable by other applications.

SANE-1.0.27

  Introduction to SANE

   SANE is short for Scanner Access Now Easy. Scanner access, however, is far
   from easy, since every vendor has their own protocols. The only known
   protocol that should bring some unity into this chaos is the TWAIN
   interface, but this is too imprecise to allow a stable scanning framework.
   Therefore, SANE comes with its own protocol, and the vendor drivers can't
   be used.

   SANE is split into back ends and front ends. The back ends are drivers for
   the supported scanners and cameras. The front ends are user interfaces to
   access the backends.

   This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS-9.0
   platform.

   User Notes: http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/sane

  Kernel Configuration, Drivers and Additional Packages

   To access your scanner, you will probably need the related kernel drivers
   and/or additional support packages. A SCSI scanner will need SCSI drivers,
   a parallel port scanner needs parallel port support (you should use
   enhanced EPP modes) and perhaps libieee1284, and a USB scanner will need
   the libusb-1.0.22 package. For HP devices, you may need hplip. Ensure you
   have the necessary drivers properly configured to access the devices.

  Installation of SANE

    Installation of SANE Back Ends

   The SANE daemon should run with its own group. Create this group by
   issuing the following commands as the root user:

 groupadd -g 70 scanner

  Note

   configure assumes that the user building SANE-backends is a member of the
   scanner group for testing the existence of this group. So the user
   building the package should be added to the scanner group. As the root
   user:

 usermod -G scanner -a username

   For a USB scanner, if you are linking to libusb-1.0.22, include the
   configure switch --enable-libusb_1_0. Install SANE-backends by running the
   following commands:

 sg scanner -c "                  \
 ./configure --prefix=/usr        \
             --sysconfdir=/etc    \
             --localstatedir=/var \
             --with-group=scanner \
             --with-docdir=/usr/share/doc/sane-backends-1.0.27" &&
 make

   To test the results, issue: make check.

   Now, as the root user:

 make install                                         &&
 install -m 644 -v tools/udev/libsane.rules           \
                   /etc/udev/rules.d/65-scanner.rules &&
 chgrp -v scanner  /var/lock/sane

   With the scanner on, run scanimage -L and the name and location of the
   device should appear. Of course, you need the device drivers configured,
   in order to run this test.

    Installation of SANE Front Ends

   The SANE-frontends package includes the graphical frontends xscanimage and
   xcam, and a command-line frontend scanadf. You don't need this package if
   you intend to use one of the more advanced graphical frontends like
   XSane-0.999. For a list of frontend packages, see
   http://www.sane-project.org/sane-frontends.html.

   To install SANE-frontends, use the following commands:

 tar -xf ../sane-frontends-1.0.14.tar.gz &&
 cd sane-frontends-1.0.14                &&

 sed -i -e "/SANE_CAP_ALWAYS_SETTABLE/d" src/gtkglue.c &&
 ./configure --prefix=/usr --mandir=/usr/share/man &&
 make

   This package does not come with a test suite.

   Now, as the root user:

 make install &&
 install -v -m644 doc/sane.png xscanimage-icon-48x48-2.png \
     /usr/share/sane

   If GIMP was linked into the build and you wish GIMP to use xscanimage as a
   scanning plugin, issue the following command as the root user:

 ln -v -s ../../../../bin/xscanimage /usr/lib/gimp/2.0/plug-ins

  Note

   If the plugin xscanimage is disabled in GIMP's menu, in order to enable
   it, "create" a blank image using the menu or Ctrl-N. After that, it is
   enabled.

  Command Explanations

   sg scanner -c "...": runs the command between double quotes with principal
   group scanner. This may be needed if the user has been newly added to
   group scanner, and has not looged out and in.

   --sysconfdir=/etc: This switch installs the configuration files in
   /etc/sane.d instead of /usr/etc/sane.d.

   --with-group=scanner: This parameter causes the directory created for the
   locking files to be group owned by the scanner group instead of the
   default uucp group.

   exit: This command is used to exit the shell created by the su command.

  Configuring SANE

    Config Files

   /etc/sane.d/*.conf

    Configuration Information

      Backend Configuration

   The backend configuration files are located in /etc/sane.d. Information
   for configuring the various backends can be found by using the man(5) page
   for the desired backend. Run man sane-<backend>, substituting the desired
   backend.

   Add any desired users to the scanner group.

   If you want to access a network scanner, include two lines in net.conf, as
   root user (make sure to replace <server_ip> by the actual value, below):

 cat >> /etc/sane.d/net.conf << "EOF"
 connect_timeout = 60
 <server_ip>
 EOF

   On the server side, include the client ip in the access list of
   /etc/sane.d/saned.conf, restart the saned daemon, and make sure the
   firewall, if any, is open to the client.

      Frontend Configuration

   If you use a desktop environment like Gnome or KDE you may wish to create
   a xscanimage.desktop file so that xscanimage appears in the panel's menus.
   As the root user:

 mkdir -pv /usr/share/{applications,pixmaps}               &&

 cat > /usr/share/applications/xscanimage.desktop << "EOF" &&
 [Desktop Entry]
 Encoding=UTF-8
 Name=XScanImage - Scanning
 Comment=Acquire images from a scanner
 Exec=xscanimage
 Icon=xscanimage
 Terminal=false
 Type=Application
 Categories=Application;Graphics
 EOF

 ln -svf ../sane/xscanimage-icon-48x48-2.png /usr/share/pixmaps/xscanimage.png

      General Information

   For general information about configuring and using SANE, see man sane.
   Linux-2.6.x brings some special issues into the picture. See
   http://www.sane-project.org/README.linux for information about using SANE
   with the Linux-2.6.x kernel. For information about USB scanning devices,
   run man sane-usb. For information about SCSI devices, run man sane-scsi.

      Configuration and setup of the 'saned' daemon

   The saned daemon is not meant to be used for untrusted clients. You should
   provide Firewalling protection to ensure only trusted clients access the
   daemon. Due to the complex security requirements to ensure only trusted
   clients access the daemon, BLFS does not provide instructions to configure
   the saned daemon. If you desire to make the daemon available, ensure you
   provide adequate security, configure your [x]inetd.conf file and send a
   SIGHUP to the [x]inetd daemon. Some good information for setting up and
   securing the saned daemon can be found at
   http://penguin-breeder.org/sane/saned/.

 ./configure --prefix=/usr                                           &&
 make

   This package does not come with a test suite.

   Now, as the root user:

 make xsanedocdir=/usr/share/doc/xsane-0.999 install &&
 ln -v -s ../../doc/xsane-0.999 /usr/share/sane/xsane/doc

   A browser of your choice can be used to get inline help, using the
   following command, as the root user:

 ln -v -s <browser> /usr/bin/netscape

  Note

   Be sure to replace <browser> with the browser of your choice on your
   system.

   Alternatively, if the environment variable BROWSER is set to the browser
   you want to use, eg, BROWSER="/usr/bin/firefox", the first time you run
   xsane, it will be recorded in ~/.sane/xsane/xsane.rc. If you wish to
   change it, edit this file, or remove it, and use the instructions above,
   so that a new one is created.

   If GIMP is installed, issue the following command as the root user:

 ln -v -s /usr/bin/xsane /usr/lib/gimp/2.0/plug-ins/

  Command Explanations

   ln -v -s ../../doc/xsane-0.999 /usr/share/sane/xsane/doc: This symlink is
   created to ensure that any program that looks for the XSane documentation
   in the default location will find it, as the documentation is installed in
   an alternate location specified in the make install command.

   ln -v -s /usr/bin/xsane /usr/lib/gimp/2.0/plug-ins/: This creates a link
   in the system-wide GIMP plug-ins directory so that users can access XSane
   directly from GIMP. GIMP must be available before building XSane for this
   to work. Alternatively, create the link in ~/.gimp-2.0/plug-ins/ to
   provide individual user access. man xsane for additional information.

   User Notes: http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/sgml-common

  Installation of SGML Common

   Instead of the normal convention of including the autotools files in the
   package, the maintainers included symlinks to the files in
   /usr/share/automake. For previous versions of Automake this convention is
   correct, but recent versions of Automake install the internal files in
   version specific directories. This causes the configure script to abort.
   To fix this error, the autotools are regenerated. Since the included
   Makefile.am file uses a syntax not supported by current versions of
   Automake, a patch is required to fix the syntax.

 patch -Np1 -i ../sgml-common-0.6.3-manpage-1.patch &&
 autoreconf -f -i

   Install SGML Common by running the following commands:

 ./configure --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc &&
 make

   This package does not come with a test suite.

   Now, as the root user:

 make docdir=/usr/share/doc install &&

 install-catalog --add /etc/sgml/sgml-ent.cat \
     /usr/share/sgml/sgml-iso-entities-8879.1986/catalog &&

 install-catalog --add /etc/sgml/sgml-docbook.cat \
     /etc/sgml/sgml-ent.cat

  Update Hint

   Remove the above catalog items prior to upgrading (as the root user) with:

 install-catalog --remove /etc/sgml/sgml-ent.cat \

  Command Explanations

   The above commands create an installation script for this package.

  Testing the DocBook SGML Toolchain (Optional)

   The following commands will perform the necessary tests to confirm that
   your installed DocBook SGML toolchain will produce desired results. You
   must have the docbook-3.1, docbook-4.5, OpenSP-1.5.2 and OpenJade-1.3.2
   packages installed and perform the tests as the root user.

   All tests will be performed from the
   /usr/share/sgml/docbook/dsssl-stylesheets-1.79/doc/testdata directory as
   the root user:

 cd /usr/share/sgml/docbook/dsssl-stylesheets-1.79/doc/testdata

   The first test should produce no output to stdout (your screen) and create
   a file named jtest.rtf in the current directory:

 openjade -t rtf -d jtest.dsl jtest.sgm

   The next test should return only the following line to stdout: onsgmls:I:
   "OpenSP" version "1.5.2"

 onsgmls -sv test.sgm

   The next test should produce no output to stdout and create a file named
   test.rtf in the current directory:

 openjade -t rtf \
     -d /usr/share/sgml/docbook/dsssl-stylesheets-1.79/print/docbook.dsl \
     test.sgm

   The last test should produce no output to stdout and create a file named
   c1.htm in the current directory:

 openjade -t sgml \
     -d /usr/share/sgml/docbook/dsssl-stylesheets-1.79/html/docbook.dsl \
     test.sgm

   Finally, clean up:

 rm jtest.rtf test.rtf c1.htm

DocBook-utils-0.6.14

  Introduction to DocBook-utils

   The DocBook-utils package is a collection of utility scripts used to
   convert and analyze SGML documents in general, and DocBook files in
   particular. The scripts are used to convert from DocBook or other SGML
   formats into âclassicalâ file formats like HTML, man, info, RTF and many
   more. There's also a utility to compare two SGML files and only display
   the differences in markup. This is useful for comparing documents prepared
   for different languages.

   This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS-9.0
   platform.

   User Notes: http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/docbook-utils

  Installation of DocBook-utils

   Install DocBook-utils by running the following commands:

 patch -Np1 -i ../docbook-utils-0.6.14-grep_fix-1.patch &&
 sed -i 's:/html::' doc/HTML/Makefile.in                &&

 ./configure --prefix=/usr --mandir=/usr/share/man      &&
 make

   This package does not come with a test suite.

   Now, as the root user:

 make docdir=/usr/share/doc install

   Many packages use an alternate name for the DocBook-utils scripts. If you
   wish to create these alternate names, use the following command as the
   root user:

 for doctype in html ps dvi man pdf rtf tex texi txt
 do
     ln -svf docbook2$doctype /usr/bin/db2$doctype
 done

  Note

   The jw script uses the which command to locate required utilities. You
   must install Which-2.21 before attempting to use any of the DocBook-utils
   programs.

  Command Explanations

   patch -Np1 -i ../docbook-utils-0.6.14-grep_fix-1.patch: This patch
   corrects the syntax in the jw (Jade Wrapper) script which is at the heart
   of much db2* processing, so that the current version of Grep will not
   reject it.

   sed -i 's:/html::' doc/HTML/Makefile.in: This command changes the
   installation directory of the HTML documents.

   docdir=/usr/share/doc: This option is placed on the make install line
   because is is not recognized by configure.

   Installed Symlinks: db2dvi, db2html, db2man, db2pdf, db2ps, db2rtf,
   db2tex, db2texi, and db2txt

    Short Descriptions

   docbook2* are simple one-line wrapper scripts to jw. They are provided as  
             easy-to-remember names used to convert DocBook or other SGML     
             files to the respective format.                                  
   db2*      are symlinks pointing at the respectively named docbook2*        
             commands, created to satisfy some program's use of these names.  
   jw        is a script used to convert DocBook or other SGML files to       
             various output formats. It hides most of OpenJade's complexity   
             and adds comfortable features.                                   
   sgmldiff  is used to compare two SGML files and only return the            
             differences in the markup. This is especially useful to compare  
             files that should be identical except for language differences   
             in the content.

   User Notes: http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/docbook-xsl

  Installation of DocBook XSL Stylesheets

   First, fix a problem that causes stack overflows when doing recursion:

 patch -Np1 -i ../docbook-xsl-nons-1.79.2-stack_fix-1.patch

   If you downloaded the optional documentation tarball, unpack it with the
   following command:

 tar -xf ../docbook-xsl-doc-1.79.2.tar.bz2 --strip-components=1

   BLFS does not install the required packages to run the test suite and
   provide meaningful results.

   Install DocBook XSL Stylesheets by running the following commands as the
   root user:

 install -v -m755 -d /usr/share/xml/docbook/xsl-stylesheets-nons-1.79.2 &&

 cp -v -R VERSION assembly common eclipse epub epub3 extensions fo        \

  Note

   If you are installing the current version of docbook-xsl-nons over a
   previous version of docbook-xsl, then remove the old rewrite entries in
   the catalog as the root user:

 sed -i '/rewrite/d' /etc/xml/catalog

   Create (or append) and populate the XML catalog file using the following
   commands as the root user:

 if [ ! -d /etc/xml ]; then install -v -m755 -d /etc/xml; fi &&
 if [ ! -f /etc/xml/catalog ]; then
     xmlcatalog --noout --create /etc/xml/catalog

     /etc/xml/catalog

   Occasionally, you may find the need to install other versions of the XSL
   stylesheets as some projects reference a specific version. One example is
   BLFS-6.0, which required the 1.67.2 version. In these instances you should
   install any other required version in its own versioned directory and
   create catalog entries as follows (substitute the desired version number
   for <version>):

 xmlcatalog --noout --add "rewriteSystem" \
            "http://docbook.sourceforge.net/release/xsl/<version>" \
            "/usr/share/xml/docbook/xsl-stylesheets-<version>" \
     /etc/xml/catalog &&

 xmlcatalog --noout --add "rewriteURI" \
            "http://docbook.sourceforge.net/release/xsl/<version>" \

xmlto-0.0.28

  Introduction to xmlto

   The xmlto package is a front-end to a XSL toolchain. It chooses an
   appropriate stylesheet for the conversion you want and applies it using an
   external XSLT processor. It also performs any necessary post-processing.

   This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS-9.0
   platform.

 ./configure --prefix=/usr &&

 make

   To test the results, issue: make check.

   Now, as the root user:

 make install

  Command Explanations

   LINKS="/usr/bin/links": This environment variable fixes a bug causing
   xmlto to think that links command is the same as elinks. Setting this
   variable does not cause problems if links is not installed, unless you
   have ELinks installed, and wish to use it for text backend
   post-processing, in which case, remove it.

Chapter 50. PostScript

   This chapter includes applications that create, manipulate or view
   PostScript files and create or view Portable Document Format PDF files.

a2ps-4.14

  Introduction to a2ps

   a2ps is a filter utilized mainly in the background and primarily by
   printing scripts to convert almost every input format into PostScript
   output. The application's name expands appropriately to âall to
   PostScriptâ.

   This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS-9.0
   platform.

  Caution

   a2ps cannot convert UTF-8 encoded text to PostScript. The issue is
   discussed in detail in the Needed Encoding Not a Valid Option section of
   the Locale Related Issues page. The solution is to use paps-0.6.8 instead
   of a2ps for converting UTF-8 encoded text to PostScript.

    a2ps Dependencies

      Recommended

   PSUtils-p17, and Cups-2.2.12 (otherwise, a2ps will use the cat >/dev/lp0
   command instead of lpr for sending its output to the printer)

      Optional

   ghostscript-9.27, libpaper-1.1.24+nmu5, texlive-20190410 (or
   install-tl-unx) X Window System, Adobe Reader, and Ghostview

   User Notes: http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/A2PS

  Installation of a2ps

   Install a2ps by running the following commands:

 autoconf &&
 sed -i -e "s/GPERF --version |/& head -n 1 |/" \
        -e "s|/usr/local/share|/usr/share|" configure &&

 ./configure --prefix=/usr  \
     --sysconfdir=/etc/a2ps \
     --enable-shared        \
     --with-medium=letter   &&
 make                       &&
 touch doc/*.info

   To test the results, issue: make check. The printers.tst test will fail,
   as there is no default test printer. The styles.tst may also fail, as the
   tests report some inconsistencies between the generated postscript and the
   reference sets. This is caused by version number differences between the
   postscript test files and those generated by the tests â these do not
   affect the operation of the program and can be ignored.

   Now, as the root user:

 make install

   If desired, install the downloaded i18n-fonts by running the following
   commands as the root user:

 tar -xf ../i18n-fonts-0.1.tar.bz2 &&
 cp -v i18n-fonts-0.1/fonts/* /usr/share/a2ps/fonts               &&
 cp -v i18n-fonts-0.1/afm/* /usr/share/a2ps/afm                   &&
 pushd /usr/share/a2ps/afm    &&
   ./make_fonts_map.sh        &&
   mv fonts.map.new fonts.map &&
 popd

  Command Explanations

   autoconf: This command is used to recreate the configure script. This is
   required because there is an issue in the mktime test which causes the
   configure script to hang for 60 seconds and then report that there is no
   working mktime function.

   sed -i "s/GPERF --version |/& head -n 1 |/" configure: This fixes a bug in
   the handling of the version output of gperf.

   sed -i "s|/usr/local/share|/usr/share|" configure: This command modifies
   the configure script to search for Ghostscript fonts at the location where
   they were installed by the BLFS instructions.

   --sysconfdir=/etc/a2ps: Configuration data is installed in /etc/a2ps
   instead of /usr/etc.

   --enable-shared: This switch enables building the dynamic liba2ps library.

   --with-medium=letter: This switch changes the default paper format to US
   letter. It can either be given here or set in /etc/a2ps/a2ps-site.cfg
   after installation. The default is A4, but there are several other
   options, in particular: A4dj or letterdj are good settings for HP Deskjet
   and other printers that need wider paper-handling margins. See
   /etc/a2ps/a2ps.cfg after installation.

   touch doc/*.info: This command avoids trying to regenerate the info files.
   This is an older package and the current .texi files will produce errors
   preventing make install from working properly.

   Installed Directories: /etc/a2ps and /usr/share/a2ps

    Short Descriptions

   a2ps          is a filter, utilized primarily by printing scripts, that    
                 converts standard input or supported files to PostScript.    
   card          prints a reference card of a given program's options.        
   composeglyphs creates a composite font program.                            
   fixnt         is supposed to fix the problems in the PostScript files      
                 generated by the Microsoft PostScript driver under Windows   
                 NT (3.5 and 4.0).                                            
   fixps         tries to fix common PostScript problems that break           
                 postprocessing.                                              
   ogonkify      provides international support for Postscript by performing  
                 various munging of PostScript files related to printing in   
                 different languages.                                         
   pdiff         produces a pretty comparison between files.                  
   psmandup      tries to produce a version of a given PostScript file to     
                 print in manual duplex.                                      
   psset         produces a version of a given PostScript file with a         
                 protected call to the PostScript operator 'setpagedevice'.   
                 Typical use is making a file print duplex, or on the manual  
                 tray, etc.                                                   
   texi2dvi4a2ps compiles Texinfo and LaTeX files to DVI or PDF

   User Notes: http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/fop

  Installation of fop

   Ensure $JAVA_HOME is set correctly before beginning the build. To build
   the JIMI SDK and/or XMLUnit extension classes, ensure the corresponding
   .jar files can be found via the CLASSPATH environment variable.

    Installing OFFO Hyphenation Patterns

   Copy the XML hyphenation patterns into the fop source tree by running the
   following commands:

 unzip ../offo-hyphenation.zip &&
 cp offo-hyphenation/hyph/* fop/hyph &&
 rm -rf offo-hyphenation

    Installing fop Components

   The javadoc command that ships with OpenJDK 10 and later has become much
   stricter than previous versions regarding conformance of the Javadoc
   comments in source code to HTML. The FOP documentation does not meet those
   standards, so the conformance checks have to be disabled. This can be done
   with the following command:

 sed -i '\@</javad@i\
 <arg value="-Xdoclint:none"/>\
 <arg value="--allow-script-in-comments"/>\
 <arg value="--ignore-source-errors"/>' \
     fop/build.xml

   The stack size set in build.xml for building the hyphenation patterns is
   not large enough. Change it by running:

 sed -e '/hyph\.stack/s/512k/1M/' \
     -i fop/build.xml

   With OpenJDK-12.0.2, the minimum source version is 1.7, while FOP build
   system has 1.6. Change that:

 sed -e 's/1\.6/1.7/' \
     -i fop/build.xml

   The build.xml file calls for an old version of PDFBox components that are
   no longer available. Copy the updated PDFBox components into the source
   tree:

 cp ../{pdf,font}box-2.0.16.jar fop/lib

   Compile fop by running the following commands:

 cd fop                    &&
 export LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 &&
 ant all javadocs          &&
 mv build/javadocs .

   The junit test suite was run as part of the above commands.

   Now, install Fop as the root user:

 install -v -d -m755 -o root -g root          /opt/fop-2.3 &&
 cp -vR build conf examples fop* javadocs lib /opt/fop-2.3 &&
 chmod a+x /opt/fop-2.3/fop                                &&
 ln -v -sfn fop-2.3 /opt/fop

  Command Explanations

   sed -i ... build.xml: This adds two switches to the javadoc command,
   preventing some errors to occur when building the documentation.

   export LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8: the compiler fails if using an ASCII locale.

   ant target: This reads the file build.xml and builds the target: compile
   compiles the java sources, jar-main generates jar archives,
   jar-hyphenation generates the hyphenation patterns for FOP, junit runs the
   junit tests, and javadocs builds the documentation. The all target runs
   all of the above.

   ln -v -sf fop-2.3 /opt/fop: This is optional and creates a convenience
   symlink so that $FOP_HOME doesn't have to be changed each time there's a
   package version change.

  Configuring fop

    Config Files

   ~/.foprc

    Configuration Information

   Using fop to process some large FO's (including the FO derived from the
   BLFS XML sources), can lead to memory errors. Unless you add a parameter
   to the java command used in the fop script you may receive messages
   similar to the one shown below:

   Exception in thread "main" java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space

   To avoid errors like this, you need to pass an extra parameter to the java
   command used in the fop script. This can be accomplished by creating a
   ~/.foprc (which is sourced by the fop script) and adding the parameter to
   the FOP_OPTS environment variable.

   The fop script looks for a FOP_HOME environment variable to locate the fop
   class libraries. You can create this variable using the ~/.foprc file as
   well. Create a ~/.foprc file using the following commands:

 cat > ~/.foprc << "EOF"
 FOP_OPTS="-Xmx<RAM_Installed>m"
 FOP_HOME="/opt/fop"
 EOF

   Replace <RAM_Installed> with a number representing the amount of RAM
   installed in your computer (in megabytes). An example would be
   FOP_OPTS="-Xmx768m".

   To include the fop script in your path, update the system-wide profile
   with the following command as the root user:

 cat > /etc/profile.d/fop.sh << "EOF"
 # Begin /etc/profile.d/fop.sh

 pathappend /opt/fop

 # End /etc/profile.d/fop.sh
 EOF

  Note

   Running fop can be somewhat verbose. The default logging level can be
   changed from INFO to any of FINEST, FINER, FINE, CONFIG, INFO, WARNING,
   SEVERE, ALL, or OFF. To do this, edit
   $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/logging.properties and change the entries for .level
   and java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler.level to the desired value.

Chapter 51. Typesetting

   This chapter includes texlive applications that create output equivalent
   to typesetting.

   There are two alternative routes through this chapter:

   Some people may wish to use the binary installer, either because of the
   complexity of installing all of texlive from source, or because they only
   want a part of the package, or perhaps because they wish to get updates as
   soon as those are available (the source is only updated annually, but the
   binaries and associated tex and sty files are updated for approximately 10
   months). These people should begin at Setting the PATH for TeX Live and
   then follow the install-tl-unx instructions,. After installing, they can
   run tlmgr to update their system.

   Most people reading BLFS will wish to build from source. BLFS used to
   start by installing install-tl-unx and then use that to bootstrap the
   build. Nowadays, we build almost the whole of texlive without a binary
   install, by adding the separately-packaged texmf files into this build.
   For this, begin at Setting the PATH for TeX Live then go to
   texlive-20190410 which will install most of texlive, together with all of
   the supporting files. This almost-complete install can then be used to
   build the remaining parts of texlive: asymptote-2.52, biber-2.13 and
   xindy-2.5.1.

   Because the texmf files (including documentation, fonts, scripts and
   supporting files) are all in one tarball, it is not practical to limit
   what gets extracted in a sensible way (you could exclude one or other of
   the typesetting engines, not its many supporting files) when building from
   source in this manner.

   In either case, BLFS installs into /opt/texlive/2019.

   Also, please note that texlive is released annually, and updating from the
   previous year to the current year is no longer supported. If for some
   reason you wish to keep versions for multiple years, for most things you
   can mount the old or new system at /opt/texlive and fix up your PATH as
   necessary. However doing that will not preserve any changes in texmf-local
   and if you build from source and try to run a newer version of biber with
   an older version of biblatex it is unlikely to work.

Setting the PATH for TeX Live

   Before starting to build TeX Live, set up your PATH so that the system can
   properly find the files. If you set up your login scripts as recommended
   in The Bash Shell Startup Files, update the needed paths by appending to
   the extrapaths.sh script. The programs are always installed in an
   <ARCH>-linux subdirectory and on 32-bit x86 this is always i386-linux. For
   x86_64 and i?86 we can generate this as $TEXARCH:

 export TEXARCH=$(uname -m | sed -e 's/i.86/i386/' -e 's/$/-linux/') &&

 cat >> /etc/profile.d/extrapaths.sh << EOF
 # Begin texlive addition

 pathappend /opt/texlive/2019/texmf-dist/doc/man  MANPATH
 pathappend /opt/texlive/2019/texmf-dist/doc/info INFOPATH
 pathappend /opt/texlive/2019/bin/$TEXARCH

 # End texlive addition
 EOF

 unset TEXARCH

   The new paths can be immediately activated by running source /etc/profile.

   You should now proceed either to install-tl-unx for a binary installation
   of texlive, or to texlive-20190410 to begin installing from source.

install-tl-unx

  Introduction to TeX Live and its installer

   The TeX Live package is a comprehensive TeX document production system. It
   includes TeX, LaTeX2e, ConTeXt, Metafont, MetaPost, BibTeX and many other
   programs; an extensive collection of macros, fonts and documentation; and
   support for typesetting in many different scripts from around the world.

   This page is for people who wish to use the binary installer to provide
   the programs, the scripts, and a lot of supporting files and
   documentation. The installer is updated frequently, so its md5sum will
   change if it is newer than what is shown below. Newer versions of the
   installer are expected to work with these instructions, for so long as
   they install to a 2019/ directory.

   There are two reasons why you may wish to install the binaries in BLFS:
   either you need a smaller install (e.g. at a minimum plain TeX without
   LaTeX2e, ConTeXt, etc), or you wish to use tlmgr to get updates whilst
   this version is supported (typically, until April of the year after it was
   released). For the latter, you might prefer to install in your /home
   directory as an unprivileged user, and to then make corresponding changes
   to the PATH in your ~/.bashrc or equivalent.

   This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS-9.0
   platform.

     * Download size: 3.8 MB

     * Estimated disk space required: 6.2 GB if everything is included

     * Estimated build time: varies, depending on network speed and traffic

      Recommended

   GnuPG-2.2.17 (to validate both the initial downloads, and also any updates
   you might later make using tlmgr.)

      Recommended (at runtime)

   The binaries are mostly linked to included static libraries or general
   (LFS) system libraries, but a few of the programs and several scripts will
   fail if the following packages are not present:

   ghostscript-9.27 is dynamically loaded by the external application
   dvisvgm, which is used by asy when that creates SVG files.

   Xorg Libraries and libxcb-1.13.1 are needed for inimf, mf, pdfclose,
   pdfopen and xdvi-xaw. But if you are using asy, or using a TeX engine to
   create a PDF file, you will need an X Window System (for PDF files, this
   is to support a PDF viewer of your choice, for example epdfview-0.1.8).

   the optional non-wide-character ncurses library (for "some binary-only
   application") from the bottom of the Ncurses page in LFS is needed for
   xindy.run which is used by xindy

   The binary version of asy needs Freeglut-3.0.0.

   As always with contributed binary software, it is possible that the
   required dependencies may change when the installer is updated. In
   particular, these dependencies have only been checked on x86_64.

   Python-2.7.16 is used by many scripts. Ruby-2.6.4 is used by some scripts,
   mostly within mtx_context which is part of conTeXt, but also for one or
   two others, such as match_parens, which are generally useful. The perl
   module Tk, which requires Tk-8.6.9, is used by one of the scripts for ptex
   (Japanese vertical writing), can be used by a conTeXt texfind script, and
   is needed for texdoctk (a GUI interface for finding documentation files
   and opening them with the appropriate viewer).

   User Notes: http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/tl-installer

  Binary Installation of TeX Live

   The TeX Live set of programs with its supporting documents, fonts, and
   utilities is very large. The upstream maintainers recommend placing all
   files in a single directory structure. BLFS recommends /opt/texlive.

   As with any other package, unpack the installer and change into its
   directory, install-tl-<CCYYMMDD>. This directory name changes when the
   installer is updated, so replace <CCYYMMDD> by the correct directory name.

  Note

   The distribution binaries installed below may use static linking for
   general linux system libraries. Additional libraries or interpreters as
   specified in the dependencies section do not need to be present during the
   install, but the programs that need them will not run until their specific
   dependencies have been installed.

   With all contributed binary software, there may be a mismatch between the
   builder's toolchain and your hardware. In most of TeX this will probably
   not matter, but in uncommon corner cases you might hit problems. e.g. if
   your x86_64 processor does not support 3dnowext or 3dnow, the 2014-06-28
   binary failed in conTeXt when running LuaTeX, although lualatex worked, as
   did the i686 binaries on the same machine. In such cases, the easiest
   solution is to install texlive from source. Similarly, the x86_64 binary
   version of asy runs very slowly when creating 3-D diagrams.

   Now, as the root user:

 TEXLIVE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt/texlive ./install-tl

   This command is interactive and allows selection or modification of
   platform, packages, directories, and other options. The full installation
   scheme will require about 4.9 gigabytes of disk space. The time to
   complete the download will depend on your internet connection speed and
   the number of packages selected.

  Command Explanations

   ./install-tl --location
   http://mirror.aut.ac.nz/CTAN/systems/texlive/tlnet/: use a variation of
   this if you wish to use a different mirror, e.g. because you are in New
   Zealand but the installer chooses to use an Australian mirror. The list of
   mirrors is at http://ctan.org/mirrors.

  Contents

   Installed Programs: Over 300 binaries and symlinks to scripts
   Installed Libraries: None
   Installed Directories: /opt/texlive

    Short Descriptions

   TeX programs The programs included in TeX are too numerous to individually 
                list. Please refer to the individual program HTML and PDF     
                pages in the various html, man, or pdf files within the       
                subdirectories of 2019/texmf-dist/. Using texdoc pdflatex (   
                replace pdflatex with the command name ) may also be useful.

texlive-20190410-source

  Introduction to TeX Live from source

   Most of TeX Live can be built from source without a pre-existing
   installation, but xindy (for indexing) needs working versions of latex and
   pdflatex when configure is run, and the testsuite and install for asy (for
   vector graphics) will fail if TeX has not already been installed.
   Additionally, biber is not provided within the texlive source.

   All of those packages are dealt with on their own pages and can be built
   after installing this package. If you have not already done so, you should
   start at Setting the PATH for TeX Live so that the final commands to
   initialise the new installation will be found.

   This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS-9.0
   platform.

    TeX Live from source Dependencies

      Recommended

   ghostscript-9.27 including libgs.so, X Window System

   The source ships with its own versions of many libraries, and will use
   them unless it is forced to use the system versions. The following are
   recommended so that the system version will be used: Fontconfig-2.13.1,
   FreeType-2.10.1, GC-8.0.4, Graphite2-1.3.13, HarfBuzz-2.6.0 (built with
   graphite2 enabled), ICU-64.2, libpaper-1.1.24+nmu5 (used by at least
   context and xelatex), and libpng-1.6.37

   Furthermore, the instructions below assume you are using the layout
   described in Setting the PATH for TeX Live.

      Optional

   The source ships with its own versions of several libraries which are
   either not under active development, or only used for limited
   functionality. If you install these, as with some other optional
   dependencies in this book you will need to tell configure to use the
   system versions. GD, t1lib, ZZIPlib, TECkit

      Runtime dependencies

   Python-2.7.16 is used by many scripts. Ruby-2.6.4 is used by some scripts,
   mostly within mtx_context which is part of conTeXt, but also for one or
   two others, such as match_parens, which are generally useful. The perl
   module Tk, which requires Tk-8.6.9, is used by one of the scripts for ptex
   (Japanese vertical writing), can be used by a conTeXt texfind script, and
   is needed for texdoctk (a GUI interface for finding documentation files
   and opening them with the appropriate viewer).

   User Notes: http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/texlive

  Installation of TeX Live

   Install TeX Live by running the following commands:

   The shared libraries will be installed into a texlive directory. As the
   root user, add it to your /etc/ld.so.conf:

 cat >> /etc/ld.so.conf << EOF
 # Begin texlive 2019 addition

 /opt/texlive/2019/lib

 # End texlive 2019 addition
 EOF

  Note

   From 2015 onwards, a successful install requires some texlive commands to
   be run as the root user, so we will export the TEXARCH variable to let
   root use it.

   In the 2019 release, dvisvgm cannot be built if shared system libraries
   are used. This means that asymptote-2.52 will not be able to create svg
   files.

   Now, as a normal user:

 export TEXARCH=$(uname -m | sed -e 's/i.86/i386/' -e 's/$/-linux/') &&

 make

   To test the results, issue: make check A few tests may SKIP because
   kpathsea has not yet been installed.

   Now, as the root user:

 make install-strip &&
 /sbin/ldconfig &&
 make texlinks &&
 mkdir -pv /opt/texlive/2019/tlpkg/TeXLive/ &&
 install -v -m644 ../texk/tests/TeXLive/* /opt/texlive/2019/tlpkg/TeXLive/

  Note

   Only run make texlinks once. If it is rerun, it can change all the program
   symlinks so that they point to themselves and are useless.

   Now install the additional files as the root user:

 tar -xf ../../texlive-20190410-texmf.tar.xz -C /opt/texlive/2019 --strip-components=1

   Still as the root user, initialise the new system (the commands
   fmtutil-sys --all and mtxrun --generate will produce a lot of output):

 mktexlsr &&
 fmtutil-sys --all &&
 mtxrun --generate

   You can now proceed to asymptote-2.52, biber-2.13 and / or xindy-2.5.1 if
   you wish to install them.

  Command Explanations

   patch -Np1 -i ../texlive-20190410-source-upstream_fixes-1.patch: various
   problems have come to light since the shipped source was frozen to be
   committed to DVDs.

   --prefix=, --bindir=, --datarootdir=, --infodir=, --mandir= ... : these
   switches ensure that the files installed from source will overwrite any
   corresponding files previously installed by install-tl-unx so that the
   alternative methods of installing texlive are consistent.

   --includedir=, --libdir= ... : these switches ensure that the libraries
   and include files will be within the directories for this year's texlive.

   --disable-static: This switch prevents installation of static versions of
   the libraries.

   --enable-shared: Use shared versions of libkpathsea, libptexenc,
   libsynctex, libtexlua52 and libtexluajit.

   --with-system-...: Unless this parameter is used, the included versions of
   these libraries will be statically compiled into the programs which need
   them. If you decided not to install a recommended library, omit the
   corresponding switch.

   --disable-dvisvgm: As noted above, the shipped version of dvisvgm, which
   has modified configuration files, cannot be built with shared system
   libraries.

   --without-x: use this if you do not have Xorg installed.

   /sbin/ldconfig: this has to be run here so that make texlinks can use
   kpsewhich.

   make texlinks : this runs the texlinks.sh script to create symbolic links
   from formats to engines. In practice, several of the targets such as xetex
   are now separate binaries and for these it will report "file already
   exists".

   tar -xf texlive-20190410-texmf.tar.xz -C /opt/texlive/2019
   --strip-components=1: the tarball contains the files for the texmf-dist
   directory, and because of its size we do not want to waste time and space
   untarring it and then copying the files.

   install -v -m644 ../texk/tests/TeXLive/* /opt/texlive/2019/tlpkg/TeXLive/:
   This puts the perl modules TLConfig.pm and TLUtils.pm into the directory
   where the binary installer puts them - it is at the start of the perl
   @INC@ PATH within texlive when installed using the above configure
   switches. Without these modules, texlive is unusable.

   mktexlsr: Create an ls-R file which lists what was installed - this is
   used by kpathsea to find files.

   fmtutil-sys --all: This initializes the TeX formats, Metafont bases and
   Metapost mems.

   mtxrun --generate: This initializes the ConTeXt system.

xindy-2.5.1

  Introduction to xindy

   Xindy is an index processor that can be used to generate book-like indexes
   for arbitrary document-preparation systems. This includes systems such as
   TeX and LaTeX, the roff-family, and SGML/XML-based systems (e.g., HTML)
   that process some kind of text and generate indexing information.

   This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS-9.0
   platform.

      Required

   Clisp-2.49 and texlive-20190410

   User Notes: http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/xindy

  Installation of xindy

   Install xindy by running the following commands:

 export TEXARCH=$(uname -m | sed -e 's/i.86/i386/' -e 's/$/-linux/') &&

 sed -i "s/ grep -v '^;'/ awk NF/" make-rules/inputenc/Makefile.in &&

 sed -i 's%\(indexentry\)%\1\\%' make-rules/inputenc/make-inp-rules.pl &&

 patch -Np1 -i ../xindy-2.5.1-upstream_fixes-1.patch &&

 ./configure --prefix=/opt/texlive/2019              \

             --libdir=/opt/texlive/2019/texmf-dist   \
             --mandir=/opt/texlive/2019/texmf-dist/doc/man &&

 make LC_ALL=POSIX

   This package does not have a testsuite.

   Now, as the root user:

 make install

  Command Explanations

   sed -i "s/ grep -v '^;'/ awk NF/" ...: The build sorts files in
   latin{1..3} encodings to create latin.xdy, and unicode versions of these
   to create utf8.xdy after using grep -v '^;' to remove blank lines. With
   grep-2.23 any data not in the expected encoding is treated as binary,
   resulting in a useless file. This command uses an alternative way of
   removing blank lines.

   sed -i 's%\(indexentry\)%\1\\%' ...: A regexp contains indexentry{ - perl
   has warned about the unescaped left brace for some time and now treats it
   as illegal. Change it to indexentry\{, doubling the backslash for sed.

   patch -Np1 -i ../xindy-2.5.1-upstream_fixes-1.patch: Xindy is now
   maintained at CTAN. This patch updates the source with some of the changes
   made there (but ignoring changes which were only made to allow for spaces
   in pathnames and some trivial recent changes).

   --prefix=, --bindir=, --datarootdir=, --infodir=, --mandir= ... : these
   switches ensure that the files installed from source will overwrite any
   corresponding files previously installed by install-tl-unx so that the
   alternative methods of installing texlive are consistent.

   --includedir=/usr/include: This parameter ensures that the kpathsea
   headers from texlive-20190410 will be found.

   make LC_ALL=POSIX: with the current version of coreutils it is essential
   to build xindy in the POSIX (or C) locale because in a UTF-8 locale the
   file latin.xdy will contain only a heading and then a line 'Binary file
   (standard input) matches' instead of the many lines of lisp merge-rule
   commands it ought to contain.

   Installed Programs: tex2xindy, texindy, xindy
   Installed Libraries: None

    Short Descriptions

   tex2xindy transforms a LaTeX index file into a xindy raw index file.       
   texindy   is a wrapper for xindy that turns on many LaTeX conventions by   
             default.                                                         
   xindy     creates a sorted and tagged index from a raw LaTeX index.

         1. to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more
            Collective Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in
            the Collective Works;

         2. to create and reproduce Derivative Works;

         3. to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly,
            perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital
            audio transmission the Work including as incorporated in
            Collective Works;

         4. to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly,
            perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital
            audio transmission Derivative Works;

       The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now
       known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make
       such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights
       in other media and formats. All rights not expressly granted by
       Licensor are hereby reserved, including but not limited to the rights
       set forth in Sections 4(e) and 4(f).

    4. Restrictions.The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made
       subject to and limited by the following restrictions:

         1. You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or
            publicly digitally perform the Work only under the terms of this
            License, and You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource
            Identifier for, this License with every copy or phonorecord of
            the Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or
            publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any terms
            on the Work that alter or restrict the terms of this License or
            the recipients' exercise of the rights granted hereunder. You may
            not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that
            refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties. You
            may not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or
            publicly digitally perform the Work with any technological
            measures that control access or use of the Work in a manner
            inconsistent with the terms of this License Agreement. The above
            applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but
            this does not require the Collective Work apart from the Work
            itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You
            create a Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must,
            to the extent practicable, remove from the Collective Work any
            reference to such Licensor or the Original Author, as requested.
            If You create a Derivative Work, upon notice from any Licensor
            You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Derivative
            Work any reference to such Licensor or the Original Author, as
            requested.

         2. You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or
            publicly digitally perform a Derivative Work only under the terms
            of this License, a later version of this License with the same
            License Elements as this License, or a Creative Commons iCommons
            license that contains the same License Elements as this License
            (e.g. Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 2.0 Japan). You must
            include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this
            License or other license specified in the previous sentence with
            every copy or phonorecord of each Derivative Work You distribute,
            publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally
            perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Derivative
            Works that alter or restrict the terms of this License or the
            recipients' exercise of the rights granted hereunder, and You
            must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to
            the disclaimer of warranties. You may not distribute, publicly
            display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the
            Derivative Work with any technological measures that control
            access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms
            of this License Agreement. The above applies to the Derivative
            Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not
            require the Collective Work apart from the Derivative Work itself
            to be made subject to the terms of this License.

         3. You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section
            3 above in any manner that is primarily intended for or directed
            toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation. The
            exchange of the Work for other copyrighted works by means of
            digital file-sharing or otherwise shall not be considered to be
            intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private
            monetary compensation, provided there is no payment of any
            monetary compensation in connection with the exchange of
            copyrighted works.

         4. If you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or
            publicly digitally perform the Work or any Derivative Works or
            Collective Works, You must keep intact all copyright notices for
            the Work and give the Original Author credit reasonable to the
            medium or means You are utilizing by conveying the name (or
            pseudonym if applicable) of the Original Author if supplied; the
            title of the Work if supplied; to the extent reasonably
            practicable, the Uniform Resource Identifier, if any, that
            Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such
            URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing
            information for the Work; and in the case of a Derivative Work, a
            credit identifying the use of the Work in the Derivative Work
            (e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or
            "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author"). Such
            credit may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided,
            however, that in the case of a Derivative Work or Collective
            Work, at a minimum such credit will appear where any other
            comparable authorship credit appears and in a manner at least as
            prominent as such other comparable authorship credit.

         5. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical
            composition:

              1. Performance Royalties Under Blanket Licenses. Licensor
                 reserves the exclusive right to collect, whether
                 individually or via a performance rights society (e.g.
                 ASCAP, BMI, SESAC), royalties for the public performance or
                 public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work if
                 that performance is primarily intended for or directed
                 toward commercial advantage or private monetary
                 compensation.

              2. Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties. Licensor reserves
                 the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via
                 a music rights agency or designated agent (e.g. Harry Fox
                 Agency), royalties for any phonorecord You create from the
                 Work ("cover version") and distribute, subject to the
                 compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 115 of the US
                 Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions), if
                 Your distribution of such cover version is primarily
                 intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or
                 private monetary compensation. 6. Webcasting Rights and
                 Statutory Royalties. For the avoidance of doubt, where the
                 Work is a sound recording, Licensor reserves the exclusive
                 right to collect, whether individually or via a
                 performance-rights society (e.g. SoundExchange), royalties
                 for the public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the
                 Work, subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC
                 Section 114 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in
                 other jurisdictions), if Your public digital performance is
                 primarily intended for or directed toward commercial
                 advantage or private monetary compensation.

         6. Webcasting Rights and Statutory Royalties. For the avoidance of
            doubt, where the Work is a sound recording, Licensor reserves the
            exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a
            performance-rights society (e.g. SoundExchange), royalties for
            the public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work,
            subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 114
            of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other
            jurisdictions), if Your public digital performance is primarily
            intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private
            monetary compensation.

    5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

       UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING,
       LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR
       WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED,
       STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF
       TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,
       NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY,
       OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE.
       SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES,
       SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

    6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE
       LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY
       FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY
       DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF
       LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

    7. Termination

         1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
            automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this
            License. Individuals or entities who have received Derivative
            Works or Collective Works from You under this License, however,
            will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals
            or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses.
            Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of
            this License.

         2. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted
            here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright
            in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the
            right to release the Work under different license terms or to
            stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that
            any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any
            other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under
            the terms of this License), and this License will continue in
            full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.

    8. Miscellaneous

         1. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work
            or a Collective Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient a
            license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the
            license granted to You under this License.

         2. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform a
            Derivative Work, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to
            the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license
            granted to You under this License.

         3. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable
            under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or
            enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and
            without further action by the parties to this agreement, such
            provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to
            make such provision valid and enforceable.

         4. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and
            no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in
            writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or
            consent.

         5. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties
            with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no
            understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the
            Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any
            additional provisions that may appear in any communication from
            You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written
            agreement of the Licensor and You.
